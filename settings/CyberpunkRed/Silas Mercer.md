Silas is a fixer in [[Night City]] with delusions of grandeur. Untrustworthy, mean, and as likely to pay you as to shoot you in the back and dump you in the sewer, he's not the first choice for work for anyone but the naive, the inexperienced, and the desperate. 

Silas gave himself the street name "Sovereign". He believes himself to be God's gift to Night City - the city is just too stupid to realize it yet. Of course, it's only a matter of time before Silas Mercer is a household name.

Everyone else refers to him as "Tinpot", a reference to being a tinpot dictator, ultimately of no real significance.
