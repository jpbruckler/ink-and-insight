# Undermist

Campaign:: [[Sumon-Ho]]
Setting:: [[scalinea]]

## Description

![[Undermist Travel]]


The Undermist is a pitch dark, labyrinthine layer that sits between the Underdark and "under ground". It's like continuous smoke. It's nearly impossible to breathe because of the smoke unless under the effects of the Aid spell, or when covering one's mouth.
