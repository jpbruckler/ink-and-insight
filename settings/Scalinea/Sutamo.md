Sutamo was a follower of [[Tuoni]] before his ascension. He is a powerful fighter, but
emphasizes taking advantage of other skills as well. Sutamo does not believe that a fair
fight is judged by equal Strength or awareness, rather he believes that a warrior should
fight with all his available resources. Energy is spent on developing non-combat skills, so
they should be available for a battle as well. Numerous rogues and thugs worship
Sutamo, keeper of the night. Although Sutamo does not seek out such company, he does
not discourage it either. Some assassins, primarily those that kill for reasons other than
money, worship Sutamo as well.
Sutamo’s clerics and worshippers are not easy to recognize. They simply appear as hard-
working citizens. Their few temples are often remote or well disguised. Most formal
worship happens late at night, particularly during full moons.

### Holy Warrior code
- Holy Warriors must protect faithful clergy and holy places of Sutamo.
- Holy Warriors must obey senior clergy and templars, unless detrimental to the religion.
- Holy Warriors must tithe 10% of all earnings.
- Holy Warriors must challenge themselves in their actions.
- Holy Warriors must seek advantages that will be used in the defeat of their enemies.
- Holy Warriors must not seek glory or high praise. Although recognition may come to those who earn it, seeking recognition is a sin that will be punished by fate.
