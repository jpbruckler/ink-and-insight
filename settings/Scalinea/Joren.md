# King Joren

## Notes

Joren was an adventurer during the [[Northern Invasion]]. As [[Julo Aimes]] brought half the civilized world together to keep the remnants of the army from destroying communities, Joren became the General of the [[Southern Army]] and developed the line of forts below the [[üó∫Ô∏è The Great Forest]] separating [[50 TTRPG/51 Settings/Scalinea/Aimesland]] from the [[Ravaged Lands|Conquered Lands]] . As the line was settled, [[50 TTRPG/51 Settings/Scalinea/Aimesland]] was divided. Joren became the monarch of what came to be known as the [[Jorenian Kingdom]].
