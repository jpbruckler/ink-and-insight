## Description

- Can detect the current location of [[Soulstriker]], unless it's in a Bag of Holding.
- Attacked [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] right after speaking with [[Averos]] . The timing of the attack lead the party to initially believe that he ([[Averos]]) was involved with the attack. We later discovered that it wasn't him, but the Agents of Tloques.
