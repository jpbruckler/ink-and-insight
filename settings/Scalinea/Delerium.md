# [[Delerium]]


*About delerium Averos said, “Yes, you mentioned delerium. I have done extensive research on…well…a lot of things. I know of one element called delerium, but I’m not aware of it being here on our world. Hopefully it is just a name collision. That is some bad stuff. If you’re lucky, it will only cause you to lose your mind. It can be a world killer.

“Delerium is a magical element of unknown origin. It is a deep purple hue, but light sheens off of it in small quantities. In larger quantities, it will give off its own light. The color is hard to describe. It also gives off a vapor, not terribly important in small quantities but in larger quantities or enclosed spaces it can be a problem. It smells of a recent storm, and can cause the hair on your arms to stand up like preceding an electrical storm. Creatures that are inherently magical, including many spellcasters, can sense the stuff. And it is alluring to them. It is a magical element, in one case referred to as ‘magic condensation.’ Just don’t take that too literally…at least I don’t think you should.

“Delerium will cause degradation and mutations in creatures that come in contact with it, as it is absorbed into the skin. Even the vapor can be altering over time. At a minimum, it will degrade the mental faculties like a powerful drug or other toxin. But it can also mutate a creature into an aberration.

“It responds to magic. It can both enhance and negate magic, depending on its use. It glows in the presence of magic or moonlight. Its crystalline state divides over time, causing it to grow. This division happens more quickly in the presence of magic, which is where I think the condensation idea comes from. But over centuries it can cause irreparable damage to a world. Hopefully, what you’re hearing about is something that happened to be named the same.”
