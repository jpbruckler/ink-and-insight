According to [[Olgann]]:
 - They are [[Stones of Power|Power Stones]]. He would have called it a crimson [[Stones of Power|Power Stone]], not a [[Stones of Power|Stones of Power]]. He didn't know that name.
 - There are different [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] and [[Elinor]] noted he started to get cautious as they asked about his other [[Stones of Power|Power Stones]].
 -  When "we got our stones" [[Glorgona]] was trying to perform a ritual that would take one of the dwarven cities to Hell. She was assisted by a [[Knight of the Night]] tiefling named [[Majesty]] and a group of [[Deadstone Giants]]
 - [[Glorgona]]'s ritual required at least 4 stones, but she was working on getting a fifth when [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]] and crew stopped her.

There are other Power Stones - Saphire & Emerald

1 went to [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]]
1 went to the Underdark Estate - [[Dreedasesh estate]]
1 went to [[Augustus Volgo]]
1 went to the Dwarf's (vault in the watchtower) - [[Nabrim the Terrific]]

> [!quote] Letter from [[The Prophet]]
> Dear [[Disciple Antwon]],
> 
> I greatly appreciate your successful evocation of the 1st [[Binding Site]]. This accomplishment gives us a great start to piercing the veil between our world and the restless place of the forsaken souls of the people. It is the will of the 3 true gods to return these souls to their eternal right to inhabit this land. You have clearly set yourself apart as one of the bravest and most creative of our Brotherhood. You have clearly demonstrated your ingenuity and I am forever grateful.
> 
> After establishing the 2nd [[Binding Site]], you shall meet with the acquisition team in [[Aimesville]] at the normal place. They are to acquire a Penetration Stone from the cellar of the [[Everson Estate]] locally. The owner is not expected to be cooperative. When they have it, they should deliver it to [[Disciple Kenton]].
> 
> There are also 2 Penetration Stones to be acquired in the [[Ravaged Lands]]. They are in the possession of the shaman of the Tear Bringer orc tribe and the master of the [[Passion Place]]. Delivery instructions for these stones will be given to the team upon delivery of the [[Aimesville]] stone.
> 
> There are three other Penetration Stones they should prepare to conquest. They are near the Demon’s Door so they will be extremely dangerous missions. But make them aware that this will be their responsibility when the time comes.
> 
> I personally thank you for your service. It will be an amazing accomplishment to have 2 binding sites established. A third may allow some benefit if it can be created with the power of at least 30 souls. And you’re contribution has been of great worth. I’m sure The Three will reward you beyond what even I can offer.

> Eternally,
> The Prophet

The information contained below was gleaned and condensed by Enyo and Freddie in the [[Vainamoinen library]] in [[Aimesville]]. The information was primarily sourced throughout a loose-leaf reference or journal penned by [[Vlandor Rood]]. [[Vlandor Rood|Vlandor]] seems to have run a complex spy network, sometimes commissioning the services of mages and sages. Such acts suggest that his activities were well-funded.

**Stones of Power**

Stones of Power are created from the essence of a plane. They are created of primordial materials of the plane, although there is fierce theoretical debate that the process should be able to be conducted through a low latency and stable conduit. Using a mix of divine and arcane magic over several hours, the essence is drawn from a large tract of planar material and consolidated into an extremely hard matter that is nearly indestructible. Under certain chemical inspection, it can be demonstrated that the matter pulses with the constant discharge of the plane's essence. At low levels this discharge does not seem to affect the integrity of the Stone of Power itself.

The connection to its plane of origin is strong and unbreakable. Magic utilized to interact with, draw from, or connect with that plane is enhanced and strengthened. Some very powerful spells cannot be successfully cast without augmentation by a Stone of Power as a component. Although unproven, it is likely that spells to summon or control denizens on or from the plane of origin would be similarly affected. Magic using a Stone of Power as an amplifier has an impact on the stone itself, so they would rarely be used and diminished for anything but high-level magic or times of great need by the possessor. Storing or carrying a Stone of Power on its own plane of origin for extended periods surprisingly causes unstable effects.

Research identified 5 types of Stones of Power. Theoretically, any plane that has an essence could have a Stone of Power originated from it. It is unclear if all planes can or only certain particularly oriented planes. In the research, all Stones of Power created on the same plane are the same color. It is unclear if different planes could produce the same colored Stones of Power. [[Vlandor]] was unable to find anyone claiming to know the magical spell combinations to create one, so we cannot test ourselves. It is believed that the creation either has the same combination regardless of plane, or at least part of the ritual of spells is the same. For example, there is some evidence that the Fabricate spell is required for all Stone of Power creation rituals. Much of the information uncovered is through third party sources, as we only encountered 2 Stones of Power; One crimson and one milky. 

_Crimson_

Our research has associated the crimson Stone of Power with the [[Abyss]]. Crimson Stones of Power are sometimes colloquially called Penetration Stones because of their use to penetrate the veil between our plane and the Abyss.

Enhancements as a spell component or focus:
- Strengthens spells to establish conduits to the Abyss, even permanent conduits
- Extend the duration of conjured demons, from triple duration to permanent subjugation depending on the spell and the demon’s class
- Fiends find it difficult to resist spells to charm, enslave, or banish them
- Simplifies the spell difficulty (lower spell levels) of spells to breath and move while in the Abyss
- Multiple stones could be used to power a spell that displaces a portion of the current space between them to the Abyss

Effects on nearby creatures and objects:

- Extended exposure to a crimson Stone of Power can over time animate corpses and even transform living creatures into undead.

_Black_

Our research has associated the black Stone of Power with Planar Shadow.

Enhancements as a spell component or focus:

- Strengthens spells to establish conduits to a plane of pure negative energy
- Conduits can be established that regulate the amount of negative energy that is able to traverse the conduit and/or limit its distance from the conduit mouth (up to as much as 100’)
- Cast a spell that protects the recipient from the deadly effects of traveling in the negative plane
- Spells that protect the recipient from undead draining (strength, life force, etc.) or from necrotic damage have triple the duration

Effects on nearby creatures and objects:

- Even limited exposure to a black Stone of Power can animate corpses and transform living creatures into undead within a few days.

_Emerald_

Our research has associated the emerald Stone of Power with the plane known by the names the Happy Hunting Grounds, the Beastlands, and [[Peidonmaa]]. 

Enhancements as a spell component (or possibly focus):

- Strengthens spells to establish conduits to the Beastlands
- Spells to travel through the wilds, create/purify food/water, and protect the recipient from beasts are more potent.
- Spells to conjure or control animals have their duration tripled.
- Beastland natives find it difficult to resist spells to charm or summon them.

Effects on nearby creatures and objects:

- Exposure to an emerald Stone of Power increases the intelligence and autonomy of animals and other creatures

_Azure_

Our research has associated the azure Stone of Power with the Elemental Plane of Water.

Enhancements as a spell component or focus:

- Strengthens spells to establish a conduit to the water elemental plane.
- Spells associated with water have their range, duration, and area of effect tripled. If cast on the Water elemental plane, non-instantaneous spells have a duration of 24 hours and do not require concentration.
- Spells to conjure or control water elementals and water genies have their duration tripled and their casting time halved

Effects on nearby creatures and objects:

- Exposure to an azure Stone of Power causes living creatures to lose their solid forms, gaining fluidity and lacking control over their locomotion

_Milky_

Our research has associated the milky Stone of Power with the plane of Arcadia.

Enhancements as a spell component or focus:

- Strengthens spells to establish conduits to Arcadia
- Spells associated with foreknowledge and detection have their range and duration tripled. If cast on Arcadia, non-instantaneous spells have increased potency.
- Celestials find it difficult to resist spells to charm, enslave, or banish them.
- Spells that affect beasts, insects, and plants can also affect Arcadian beasts, insects, and plants

Effects on nearby creatures and objects:

- Extended exposure to a milky Stone of Power causes creatures to lose their willingness to take the life of a living creature.
