## Notes

> [!info]
> I wanted to share with you folks some basic information that your characters may know about SLD. Rather than spend our time together sharing general information, I figured I would do it here and you can ask any specific questions about your characters knowledge on Thursday.
> 
> Most of your characters would generally know about SLD, much like you personally may generally know about the FDIC, the Fed, or SAIC (I used to work there, so this one might be a stretch). SLD has an office in most cities. They are known as brokers of information and can be commissioned to research facts. They don’t seem to get involved in politics, but have a reputation for helping people in need (likethe modern Red Cross, although not nearly that active).
> 
> Lore has it that hundreds of years ago an organization called the Archers, a collection of druids, rangers, and others, provided advice to the civilized realms and helped to fight evil that made its way into the land. (In fantasy canon, they are something between Forgotten Realm’s Harpers of the Twilight and the Druid Order in Sword of Shannara.) Its HQ was located smack dab in the middle of the Southern Lands, which is now located deep in the [[Ravaged Lands]]. None of you were old enough to remember these times, but your knowledge of the events of the [[Northern Invasion]] doesn’t include any reference to the Archers. At some point following the fall of the [[Northern Army]], SLD was founded and made their headquarters in the same area as the Archer’s HQ had been.
> 
> On a side note, the Archers still exist today. None of you have met one, but they have a reputation of actively battling against evil. For being an organization with such a long legacy, it seems to be a small but potent organization.
## Motto

>[!quote]
>The edge goes to the one with the best information and knows how to use it.

## Purpose/Goals

- Information is a crucial resource that must be sought, found, and possessed.
- Knowledge is valuable and can be well worth its cost
- Unlife is truly evil and takes away a creature’s right to a natural life
- Creating undead is the worst kind of slavery


## Description

SLD is an organization that collects and brokers in information. Offices of the SLD can be found in many locations throughout the known world, including nearly all major cities. They are considered by most to be a positive force. Historically, they have advised lords and leaders with the desire to create better and equitable governing. SLD tries to exclude itself from politics. This has caused it to have limited influence in the [[Confederation of Independent City-States|CIC]].
