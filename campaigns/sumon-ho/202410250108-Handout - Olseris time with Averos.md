# [[202410250108-Handout - Olseris time with Averos]]

[[Averos]] is a spokesman for the [[SLD]]. The [[SLD]]‚Äôs motto is ‚ÄúThe edge goes to the one with the best
information and knows how to use it.‚Äù He describes them as purveyors of information, but also
dedicated to keeping in check those who would create unlife and undeath.

[[Olseris]] traveled with [[Averos]] for just under 2 months. The group traveled with a carriage, 2 war horses, and a riding horse. The riding horse is often hitched to the carriage with [[Averos]] typically the one in it.

[[Ralph]] and [[Ereak]] are both skilled teamsters. [[Eric]] usually rides a war horse. [[Aaronnor]] is usually on a one of the other two horses.

After his resurrection, [[Averos]] and his security detail (now including [[Olseris]]) traveled to [[Aimesville]].
While there, he visited the [[SLD]] office and several contacts. He also met with a wizard and exchanged some notes. After that, they traveled to a farm south of the [[üó∫Ô∏è Dancing Drakes Inn]] Inn. [[Averos]] and [[Erika]] stayed there while the rest of the detail visited 3 of the [[Aimesland]] forts north of [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]]. A letter from the [[SLD]] was delivered to each commander, although [[Eric]] said he wasn‚Äôt certain what they said (and didn‚Äôt share any specifics). Returning a week later, the group headed to [[Trents Keep]] (the [[SLD]] HQ).

Traveling along the road to [[Trents Keep]] through the [[Ravaged Lands]], the group holds a purple
pennant high. [[Averos]] said that nearly all of the intelligent life has learned to not attack an [[SLD]] caravan that is on the road. Although disgusting work, any that do will to hunted down to pay a steep price to keep it that way.

The central building of Trent‚Äôs Keep is a 7 story tower. Its compound has several buildings and an
ancient, high wall. The tower, known as the Purple Tower, is the [[home]] of [[The Sage of Life and Death]].

[[Olseris]] was not permitted in the Purple Tower. Only Level 3 cleared people are permitted, although
Level 2 cleared people can enter the bottom floor when accompanying someone Level 3. One of the two buildings (besides his dorm) that [[Olseris]] could enter as an uncleared person was the [[College of Knowledge]]. The college is mostly a place of sages, wise-men, acolytes, and researchers, but several bards also call it home. During the 2 weeks [[Olseris]] was there, he spent his time training, reflecting, and meditating. The mix of meditation and exposure to men and women of amazing experience allowed [[Olseris]] to advance more quickly than ever before.

The group expected to be at Trent‚Äôs Keep for 3-4 weeks before heading on a 4-6 month trip across the [[Jorenian Kingdom]]. However, they were only there for two weeks. During the time at Trent‚Äôs Keep, the security detail ate lunch together every day. Usually they trained together afterwards, sometimes they talked, and sometimes they just went their separate ways. Typically they trained three days and took the fourth off. [[Eric]] trained them hard. While [[Olseris]] was generally expected to participate in the lunch and other activities of the team, his obligation was to [[Averos]] so he didn‚Äôt technically work for [[Eric]]. Therefore, he could excuse himself without ramification. 

At the beginning of the second week, [[Eric]] notified him that he had been cleared Level 1.This allowed him unescorted access to two of the three libraries.

Three or four times, [[Olseris]] met with [[Averos]]. [[Averos]] was busy meeting with other senior [[SLD]]
members, devising strategies and researching answers to nobles‚Äô requests. While [[Averos]] doesn‚Äôt even seem as naturally intelligent as [[Enyo]], he is extensively educated (proficient in all Int-based skills and has expertise in 2 of them). During their sessions, [[Averos]] asked [[Olseris]] to explain in great detail his experiences, both in childhood and adulthood. While holding back on information about his weapon and patron (unless John/[[Olseris]] wouldn‚Äôt), [[Olseris]] shared much of his experiences. 

In the discussions, he learned that [[Averos]] grew up in [[Aimesville]] and spent his young adulthood working for various sages throughout [[Aimesland]] and the [[Jorenian Kingdom]]. After making a bit of a name for himself as an academic, he was invited by [[the Sage of Life and Death]] to join the [[SLD]]. That‚Äôs when his real adventure began.

Unexpectedly, at the end of the second week in Trent‚Äôs Keep, [[Eric]] told the group they were leaving 1 hour after lunch to head to [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]]. They would have the benefit of a travel mage, so they may not be gone for more than a couple of weeks. After lunch, they met at one of the two teleportation circles known to be on the estate. They teleported to the [[SLD]] office in [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]]. 

After settling in, [[Averos]], [[Olseris]], and [[Erika]] headed for the [[üó∫Ô∏è Lavish Pumpkin]].

[[Averos]] is‚Ä¶.
 - He doesn‚Äôt much speak of faith or a specific god. He seems to be blessed by the Gods in Waiting rather than a specific deity. In a way, the [[SLD]] is his religion.
 - He is very wise and insightful, but seems more like a much older brother than father figure. He is willing to give guidance but seems to think people generally learn better from making their own mistakes (if the consequences aren‚Äôt too drastic). That doesn‚Äôt mean that he withholds his counsel from those that want it, but he doesn‚Äôt assume people want it just because they need it.
 - He expects people will do their job. For example, he expects his security detail will be able to defend their party. So, while he has several healing spells he does not prepare much combat spells. He has staples like Toll the Dead, Guiding Bolt, and Spiritual Hammer. He does usually prepare Flame Strike for when the numbers are overwhelming but beyond that, he focuses on utility and divination spells. After all, it is his duty to be prepared to act as a spokesperson, decision-maker, and advisor.
 - [[Averos]] is as wise as any person you‚Äôve ever met, and with broader experience under his belt than most. He is quite intelligent, but you‚Äôve known some smarter. He tends to be serious, not humorless but usually too thoughtful to be funny. Few emotions or intentions slip past him unnoticed, especially if he is looking for them. He isn‚Äôt particularly charismatic, but he knows how to be persuasive none-the-less.
 - In his travels, [[Averos]] often helps tend to locals ills. He generally does so with medical knowledge. This initially struck [[Olseris]] as odd, considering [[Averos]] can regrow limbs with his magic. However, eventually [[Olseris]] (and quickly [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]]) came to realize that the act of applying a salve or bandage is very personal.

During that time, knowledge is exchanged, bonds are built, and the [[SLD]]‚Äôs reputation grows. If an ill was beyond his skill as a healer (medic), he wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to rely on his magic. But while an amazing feat not everyone can do, patients seem to consider magic to be something that the caster doesn‚Äôt invest in. A simple touch and they can move on. The practice of medicine is intimate and gives time for information exchange.

Note for comparison: [[Olseris]] is mid-to-high level.
