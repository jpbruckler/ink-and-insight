Session 89 (6/13/2024): So, the hunt begins

Highlights

*After meeting with Captain Winters at breakfast, the party did odds and ends for the next 3 hours. They had received word about an hour after he left that Lord Cummings would be able to meet with them ‘before the lunchtime meal.’

*Captain Winters, Telliva the Rauha Minor, and 3 patrol officers arrived before 11 am. The officers waited in the hall.

*Lord Cummings and Heather enter:   The door opens briefly as a man walks in with gusto. He is a human in his late 40s or early 50s dressed in clothes that are fine yet functional. His bright emerald eyes and grey-streaked blond hair, combined with broad smile and obvious energy, gives an aura of being distinguished and vibrant. He is not in his prime and carries some weight at his midriff, but his firm arms and shoulders give the impression that he continuously works on it. Gwyn suspects that he is a bit overly conscious about it. He says, “My, my, this is the group. It is wonderful to meet you. Thank you for agreeing to help our noble city in these uncertain times. I know how pressed for time an adventurer is, so I’ll keep this short. As you surely know, I am Lord Aster Cummings. This lovely creature behind me is Heather, my key assistant and advisor. I couldn’t make it through the day without her keeping me on track.”    

    Moving gracefully behind him is a woman in her mid-20s. She is tall and thin, not quite unhealthy but your first thought is ‘that girl needs a sandwich.’ She wears a long, tight dress of black silk with maroon trim and a red belt. It is low cut with a slit to mid-thigh, and her long strawberry blond hair is draped in front of her. She carries a pair of journal books cradled before her in her left arm. At Lord Cummings introduction, she raises her right hand in greeting and smiles brightly, with a hint of embarrassment. Those standing close to her are treated to the faint aroma of lilac.  

*Heather gave Enyo the location of the broker who can assist the party on buying or selling magic items for their support of “this fantastic city.”

*There was some minor conflict as the Captain tried to tell the Lord he had to not share information outside the group, and as a member of the City Steward’s Advisory Board the Lord wouldn’t be told what to do…he knew what to do.

*Gwyn encouraged Lord Cummings to regale them in a story of his adventuring days. He did so. Following up with the fact that he got into business due to his marriage. He believes his willingness to take risks when needed to move things in the right direction has served the city well. He believes many are too timid at taking prudent risks.

*The party went to see Aribis Psicon, appraiser and broker. He eventually opened the door when he realized they were the group Heather told him would come. He only let the members he was told about enter, not Telliva. He went to a little food shop they passed on the way in.

*With respect to his business, he said “I am very successful at finding rare and valuable objects for sale. My brokerage clients, both the buyers and sellers, value my discretion; and my integrity. Many of the clients will hire another representative or appraiser when I am being a broker. But most don’t bother. My integrity is the most important quality. If you’re looking for a broker to lowball a client or inflate a sale price, I’m not your guy. My buyers and sellers know they can trust me when they need an appraisal, and I intend to keep it that way. My extensive client base is how I know what items are available for sale. It is possible that there are items that, if you’re willing to overpay you might be able to bring it on the market. Generally, I can’t help you with that. It is a slippery slope.”    

*The party decided to purchase a Belt of Hill Giant Strength, ring of evasion, javelin of lightning, and Arcane Grimoire +1 for 15,520 gp.

*They wanted to fund it with the sale of the Defender sword, showing it to Aribis.

* His face seems to literally brighten upon seeing the Defender shortsword. “By Coari’s beauty, that is a fabulous weapon. And it is a Defender, you say. Simply incredible. I’ve seen some of the finest weapons in existence, and I’ve rarely seen it’s equal. May I hold it?” With your permission, he takes it and tests the balance, smiling like a child holding its greatest dream. “Simply incredible.” Well, if this is a Defender as you say, it will fetch a king’s ransom. Assuming you want the gold in the next week or so, this will fetch…hmmm…45,000 gold. Ten, maybe fifteen, more if you can wait up to a year for payment.

*They will meet tomorrow at a bank.

*Rejoining Telliva the party headed to the first crime location with the intent on investigating them in order.

               -Other books in that area were damaged but mainly from throwing it down.

               -Looking at the graffiti symbol on the wall, it seemed like the eyes might have an extra line (“full eyes”) compared to the coat. It is hard to tell since the coat had been partly erased.
