After purchasing everything, 100gp per party member was left over.

We supp, sleep, and take off in the morning after breakfast.

We leave Nuthornville, walking off a little of our breakfast, then taking a bead from my necklace, we head out in a cloud of Cinnamon.

We land, Kereshi and myself change out first, then the rest of the party comes out of the cloud. 

We hut it up for 8 hours, then roll back out after the bead replenished itself in the morning, heading towards [[Strolbren Tower]]

We take an old trail pointed out to us by [[Olgann]] when he first took us to Strollbren. The first hour of travel was tight, treacherous, and difficult passing.

We pass [[Torum Needle]], a place that [[Dranaste]] pointed out was the entry to the Underdark.

Around the bend there's a tunnel through the rock. The last time we travelled here, we were ambushed by Duergar. 

I cast Bless on Kereshi, Fuzula, Enyo. Fuzula scouts out the area (30 total on the stealth check). She finds no evidence of Duergar.

Marching order: Fuzula, Kereshi, Enyo, Gwynn, Tsakor.

Within 15' of the end of the tunnel, we pick up the odor of rotting flesh, though the smell does not persist, and was likely a dead animal in the tunnel.

Near the opening of the tunnel we enter a de-file. The area outside the tunnel is in deep shadow. The ground slopes downward with a 10-15' wide path. The far end of the trail is completely dark, with 

I ask Don what we hear. 

We don't hear anything initially. Kereshi hears in her mind a plea for help. 

Kereshi: "I hear a voice in my brain"
Enyo: "Are you having thoughts?" the party laughed

The voice says it's located at the end of the trail, which is in darkness and we see a stone structure.

Kereshi: "Who are you?"
< Don: oh shit, did I give 'em a name? >
The voice responds "I'm [[Neveros]]"

Kereshi and Gwyn go up to the edge of the magical darkness. We hear a very deep voice "Much better. Thank you."

the "help" he needs is to put the pole into the darkness. Kershi thinks for a minute, then acquiesces. After a moment, a 12' tall creature with reddish skin and large pincers for arms, 2 other arms with fists, steps out of the darkness.

Gwynn is pretty sure Neveros is fiendish. (17 on an Arcana check from Gwyn, 18 from Fuzula's INT check). Neither myself nor Fuzula are pretty sure it's a Demon or some Fiend similar to that. Fuzula is struggling to remember a reference to a picture of this type of creature. These creatures are less interested in violence and destruction, and more interested in the corruption of others.

Kereshi asks where Neveros was from. He says that the "darkness" is a wormhole. He waves a hand, closing the wormhole, and explains the magic circle is actually an interplanar teleportation.

Gwyn uses sending to warn Olgann:
"Sorry for intruding. We're near the demon door. Kereshi just helped a Fiend enter the material plane. Fiend had 4 arms, 2 are pincers."

Olgann responds: 
"Why am I not surprised. Thanks."

The circle is a "magic circle" on the ground. The pole broke the circle, allowing the Glabrezu to cross.

With the darkness gone, we can see the structure. It's a half-oval portal (picture the Stargate).

Gwynn would know that most of the time, a wormhole connects 2 points, not multiple. However we have encountered a brief mention in the Journal that to get through the portal the first time we enter, one should visualize a hellscape above us, and look up. If you've been through the wormhole before, you picture what the plane looks like on the other side.

We are at the Demon's Door. The portal before us is where we need to go. Enyo investigates (21, with guidance). The area is covered with fog. Enyo doesn't find anything "material" to press. Enyo is confident that the portal is open.

Kereshi steps through, immediately. We see Kereshi enter the fog, then disappear.

The rest of us hold hands, then head into the portal (we make our group check). 

Passing through the door, there is some resistance. As we get into the portal, the air is biting cold, cold enough that our skin is red when we exit. As we make it 1/3 of the way into the door, we are pulled into the wormhole.

The inside of the wormhole smells like rotten fruit, sweet yet pungent. We have a sense of movement, though we're not really moving, we feel like we're stuck in space, but have a distinct sense of motion.

After several minutes inside the portal, a tinge of fear runs through each of us - we've been here longer than anticipated. 

On the other side, the air is hot and dry, yet the ground is moist. It's deadly silent, giving the impression that sound would travel. The area is lit by a dim light emanating from the ground.

To the right, in the sky, there is a huge, red planet. Behind us is a 4 sided, tapered edge monolith, about 7' tall. There is no "Demon Door" on this side of the portal.

Far in the distance we believe we see groups of 1-3 humanoids in the distance.

Gwyn and Tsakor don't make their saves, and fall on top of Kereshi. Gwyn is disoriented for 8 turns, Tsakor is disoriented for 10 turns.

Fuzula points out that there are 4 paths in the dirt.

1 to the left
1 to the right curving away from the monolith
the other 2 both move forward, 1 straight ahead, the other at about a 60 degree angle towards the mountains. The one going towards the mountains is the most recently used, per Fuzula.

We decide to take the trail towards the mountains.

Session 77 (8/24/2023): Whew, finally on the Putrid Plane

Highlights

* After a little strategizing, the party took an inventory of their equipment in preparation for the trip. With being uncertain what kind of environment would be present (any animals to hunt?) or if there will be anyplace to get provisions, they tried to decide what they may need; from extra arrows to sufficient food to enough soap.

* They also purchased extra diamonds as a Revivify spell component.

* Using Gwyn‚Äôs Necklace of Prayer Beads from Strolbreln, they crossed the Ravaged Lands in less than 2 days.

* Reverting on the trail behind the Strolbreln Tower, they traveled by foot to the tunnel at the entrance to the Torum Needle.

* Moving like a ghost, Fuzula determined that no ambush awaited them this time.

* The party passed through the tunnel and peered out the other side. Fuzula snuck and Kereshi prodded the floor with her new pole.

* The tunnel opened into a misty defile that sloped down for 100‚Äô to an area of deep darkness. A stone structure seemed to be hidden within the darkness. ¬†

* Kereshi heard in her mind, ‚ÄúOh, thank heaven. Someone has finally come. Please, I need your help to free me so I can be on my way. I can pay for the help and no harm will come to you. I just need help.‚Äù

* The telepath, a creature called Neberros, was in the darkness and she went down to talk to him so she wouldn‚Äôt have to yell. Gwyn followed.

* Kereshi said she wouldn‚Äôt make Neberros pay for her help. Neberros only asked for Kereshi to lay down her pole in the darkness.

* Following the request, he stepped out of the darkness. At 11‚Äô tall with red skin, 2 huge arms with pinchers and 2 large arms with fists, Neberros was an intimidating sight‚Ä¶surely a fiend of some kind. 
* Being good to his word, no harm came to Kereshi. Neberros did ask if she could spare some gold for him. Kereshi gave him 10 gp. Neberros dispelled the darkness.

* Neberros thanked Kereshi wholeheartly for helping free him and then went on his way.

* Gwyn sent a message to Olgann to let him know that Kereshi was helpful; and set a demon lose.

* Enyo inspected the Demon Door to see if she could figure out if she needed to do something to open it. At first glance, the oval structure looks like stone. But under inspection it is not like any stone you have ever seen. It is 10‚Äô wide and 20‚Äô tall, about 3‚Äô thick. The center is so thick with mist that you can‚Äôt see through it. The mist falls off and mingles with the naturally occurring mist on the mountain floor. She was convinced it was already on and a traveler would just need to step into it to use it.

* Hearing this, Kereshi thought of a ‚Äòhellscape‚Äô, looked up, and walked into the Demon Door. ‚ÄòWe might as well see what happens.‚Äô

* With Kereshi already through, and hopefully headed to the right location, the other four held hands and also walked through the portal entrance.

* Touching where the door is, you feel resistance as if the air is thick as water. As your hand passes through the fog, a bitter cold causes you to shiver. Once your body is more than a third into the mist of the door, you are suddenly pulled through the door. You can‚Äôt see more than a foot or two in the heavy fog. Nothing is felt on your skin, except extreme cold. It smells or rotten fruit; somewhat sweet but pungent. You are suspended in space but have the distinct feeling of motion.

* Kereshi exited the wormhole, followed shortly by the other 4 party members. Kereshi made a face plant. As she crouched to stay out of sight, Gwyn and Tsakor landed on her too.

* As you exit the door you are disoriented at the sudden return of gravity; struggling to keep your feet on the soft ground. It smells of bare sodden earth with the faint aroma of ammonia. The air is hot and dry despite the ground being moist. It is eerily quiet, making you suspect voices will travel for some distance.

- At first blush, it appears to be dusk or dawn as the dim light is difficult to see clearly in. However, you realize that the light is shed by the ground that you stand on‚Ä¶a ground that is also warm to the touch of anyone who fell on it. Although dim, the area is bathed in a light reminiscent of a fire beetle‚Äôs phosphorescent light. In the horizon sky to your right is a huge red glowing planet that you initially mistook for a nearby moon. Although it glows with a brighter brilliance than the ground, the color is similar. Or at least it seems to be in the red hued light you are currently surrounded by. Behind you is a 4-sided, taper-edged monolith roughly 7‚Äô tall and similar width and depth. There is no equivalent Demon Door on this side of the travel.

- Looking around in the dim light, the area is mostly flat with rolling hills in the distance a mile or two away. The ground is firm but soft. Far in the distance, you believe you see a few groups of 1 to 3 humanoids walking about their business. Fuzula points out that the ground has 4 difficult-to-notice paths worn into the dirt. One heads to the left, nearly perpendicular to the monolith. Another heads to the right, slightly curving back behind the monolith. The other two head forward, one directly so and the other at about a 60 degree angle. While frequented enough to cause a small trail near the entrance, none of them are very heavily used. Fuzula says the one toward where the mountains are on the map is the most recently used.
- Fuzula says the one toward where the mountains are on the map is the most recently used.
	* After some consideration on options, the party voted to travel along the path that headed out from at a 60 degree angle, toward the water and the area marked Death Lair on the map.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 6 pm on Month 7/Day 20

Addendum:

Two things. One, I had a typo. Ajax calls it Petos Marsh, just like your map does. He also told you the item below during your talk.¬†

* Ajax said many use the Storm Trail because most natives avoid it, but the constant lightning can be painful.


Addendum 2:
I had 7 other typos and clarifications from the recap.¬†

1 Not really 7, it is only one. I don't think the name of the hall came up in the session. In the recap, after calling it Death Hall in the title, I called it Death Hall the other two times. In case I forget to have someone in play tell you what the name of it is, I wanted to share it for your notes. The Surma facility near the Baston Door is called¬†Vankilaan Hall..

I said Baston Door here, but I've actually forgot what I called the portal during the session and it was never named in my notes. I only knew that Demon's Door wouldn't make sense to the folks on the Putrid Plane side of it. If someone wrote it down, let me know and we can go with that.
