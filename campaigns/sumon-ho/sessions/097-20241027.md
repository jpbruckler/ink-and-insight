# [[097-20241027]]

recap: of [[096-20240926|096-20240926]]

- learned [[Delerium]] was in the vault of a famous thief. Fuzula spotted a secret door
- the entire party returned, using the secret door and invisibility to gain entry


- Email Don about 
    - the Pact of the Blade
    - having rings made that are attuned to each other that would let us find the wearers


The rest of the party moves down the hall, coming to 2 doors. One of the doors is unlocked, and the other is not. 

The party finds a room full of cabinets and a secret door. We make their way through the secret door, which leads to the room that the right side door would have opened into.


This room has ivory flooring and marble + silver wall decorations. 7 glass cases, each with items. 1 table in the corner with a small box.

**Display Cases.** On each case, a notecard written in elegant handwriting bears the item's name and a brief description:

- Jeweled Human Skull. The card reads, "Unclear if genuine skull or replica. Found in ancient tomb." This skull is coated with gold. Large diamonds are mounted in its eye sockets, and small rubies drip down its cheekbones like bloody tears. (The skull is worth 2,000 gp.)
    
- Lost Map of Tishanos. The card reads, "Reportedly from Pirate Queen Shrixette Laderie. No other records of Tishanos found. Must mount expedition." This weathered map details an island that lies about a hundred miles from an unidentified coastline. (The map has no intrinsic monetary value but could lead to adventure.)
    
- Royal Scepter. The card reads, "Used in the coronation of Queen Calinia. Possible gift from elven court." This golden scepter is intricately engraved and set with diamonds and sapphires. (The scepter is worth 2,000 gp.)
    
- Ruby Diadem of Erlynn Blessedore. The card reads, "Owned by Queen Erlynn Blessedore, ancestor of Samphith." Each spire of the diadem is studded with rubies. (The diadem is worth 2,000 gp.)
    
- Silvered Dagger. The card reads, "Used to assassinate Prince Angryn Sheselitte. Nonmagical." This dagger is unremarkable, though high quality. (The dagger is worth 1,000 gp as a collector's item.)
    
- Snowy's Collar. The card reads, "Owned by legendary fortune-teller Gratchia Gartirio. Dog reportedly told the future." This fine silk collar, sized for a small dog, has a diamond-encrusted tag reading "Snowy." (The collar is worth 1,000 gp.)
    
- Thesis of Mortinsor. The card reads, "Owned by Mortinsor, the famous necromancer. Possibly contains secrets of longevity, but difficult to decipher." This oversized tome is full of esoteric, archaic text that would require extensive research to decipher. A character who spends 12 weeks studying it and succeeds on a DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana) check finds a page that serves as a [spell scroll](https://5e.tools/items.html#spell%20scroll_dmg) of [sequester](https://5e.tools/spells.html#sequester_phb). (The thesis is worth 500 gp.)

I use a charge to Detect Magic, but none are found.

The small table with the box is the center of everyone's attention. Within 15' of the box, my Arcane senses start tingling, and I am certain the box has the [[Delerium]] in it.

[[Fuzula Fastbritches]] checks for traps and finds none.

[[Kereshi Khill]] has a slight crisis of wisdom regarding the map, as it takes a bit of willpower to resist interacting with it.


An elf woman with sleek black hair is approaching, down the hall with 3 guards in tow. She says 

"You've done well, making it this far into my vault."

I try to deceive [[Lyriena]], but she doesn't buy it.

"I congratulate you... what was your name again?" 

Gwyn Hovey, I say.

She offers me another job. She wants me to go back and tell stories about her vault being impenetrable.

I take the ring ([[Ring of Evasion]]) from her and head out, after giving her my real name.

Fuzula and Kereshi make their stealh checks. [[Enyo]] does not - Lyriena lays a hand on their shoulder and asks them for their name "Enyo" they respond.

"Congratulations." Lyriena says, then lets her go.

Enyo and I find a common room to stay in (a silver piece in a dropbox), as it's about 3am.

Kereshi and Fuzula would go back to the [[üó∫Ô∏è Lavish Pumpkin]].

The next afternoon, Enyo and I make our way to the Marred Cask to ask if I could perform that evening. They mention they don't entertain, but I could tell a story outside.

Enyo and I stop for coffee and while we walk I loudly work on my new story about the Impenetrable Vault of Lyriena. Persuasion check of 25.

Telliva is waiting in the common room when Kereshi comes down.


Telliva doesn't know who Goldbeard is - he suggests we speak to [[Michael Winters]]

head to west south ward behind Telliva. We're about 25 minutes from the Front Gate before taking an unmarked lane to the South. 

Kids are playing in the street, people are all over. Everyone is watching. We feel as though we're being assessed whether we belong.

There's a big house here that's clearly seen better days. The main building, small barn and other buildings have been well maintained, but 

Paikalla is the name on the front porch. [[Paikalla]] means "[[üó∫Ô∏è Paikalla|The Spot]]"

Some old lady calls out to Telliva. 

Telliva mentions to us that the community is well maintained and the neighbors look out for each other.

There's a woman sweeping the floor - she recognizes us, though we don't immediately recognize her.

Winters and Tragedy are arguing about jurisdiction.

Winters suggests it should be stored in the Vault where the city's treasures are.

Enyo gives a speech about consulting some expert about the delerium.

[[Tragedy]] doesn't like [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]]

[[Sumis Goldbeard]] was the name of the legendary thief that was looking for the crown that Lyriena has.

Chief Inspector Farr has left Nuthornville, and will be a week before he gets to his destination (the Barbed Mountaints), and will be back in around 3 months.

We offer to go on the hunt for Inspector Farr.

They know he's headed for the Barbed Mountains, and should be there within 5 days. Tragedy also mentions that they still have Rhag and Marcus in custody - the Roha don't want to release them and lose their witnesses.

(Olseris died in the Barrier Mountains)



We have to wait until tomorrow for the Druid to prepare the spell. 


Highlights

*Enyo cast invisibility on herself, Kereshi, and Fuzula.

*Fuzula, Kereshi, and Enyo headed down the hall, turned the corner, and at the next bend turned again.

*Before them was a 30‚Äô long hall with a door across from each other in each wall.

*Kereshi tried the left door and Fuzula tried the right. An invisible Kereshi entered the unlocked door to the left. Enyo followed.

*Fuzula picked the lock in the door on the right, pushing open the metal door causing her to be electrocuted.

*There were 4 large metal cabinets in the room to the left. Kereshi/Enyo found they were all locked, but had a switch that, when pressed, made an audible click at the switch and further inside the cabinet.

*Kereshi found a secret door in the corner that must lead to the room on the right. She was able to open it with a lever on the upper right hand corner.

*Olseris, still appearing as a guard he saw earlier, reached the room. He was whistling a tune written by Elinor. Fuzula and Kereshi didn‚Äôt immediately recognize Elinor‚Äôs tune, but luckily Enyo‚Äôs quick mind put it together from the short time she had spent with Olseris.

*Crossing from the room on the left, the ‚Äòstrong room‚Äô, to the right, the ‚Äòinner vault,‚Äô via the secret doors, the party found themselves among 7 magnificent (non-magical) objects on display. With exhilaration, the party recognized the box containing the delerium in the corner of the room.

*Kereshi, between the excitement/success of the delerium find, the interest of Captain Kereshi, and the connection to his pirate dreams, Kereshi barely resisted handling the Pirate Queen‚Äôs map. She took a peak under the glass, but didn‚Äôt touch the map itself.

*The delerium was placed in Kereshi‚Äôs bag of holding. They found the component but didn‚Äôt learn anything new about its future destination or who/what was behind its procurement. In any event, it looked like world destruction may have been averted.

*Olseris ‚Äòthe guard‚Äô led his invisible companions out of the room. They stayed a ways behind him while he whistled; stopping whistling would be a sign of trouble.

*Olseris heard footsteps ahead and thought he may have heard some downstairs as well. He peaked around the corner.

*An elf woman with sleek black hair approached him with a smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done well. Not just any thieves could make it to my personal vault.‚Äù She had 3 guards with her and three more arrived soon afterwards.

*He spun a plausible tale of being a guard and chasing a group here that escaped. Her own insightfulness and gaps like being in an off limits area and his not sounding the alarm allowed her to see through the attempted deceit.

*With his invisible companions still around the corner, Olseris dropped his illusion and ‚Äòadmitted the truth‚Äô by changing his story to emphasize the thrill of getting in. When asked his name, he claimed to be ‚ÄúGwyn Hovey.‚Äù

*Lyriena said, ‚ÄúI congratulate you. Since you didn‚Äôt rob me blind, I‚Äôm sure this means the Silver Fingers placed a bounty on that ruby diadem ‚Äì Goldenbeard‚Äôs been furious about that thing for years. But if you‚Äôll offer me a moment, perhaps I can make you a better offer.‚Äù

*Olseris said he was open to hearing all offers. She said ‚ÄúI could try and dispatch you ‚Äì and I might succeed now or certainly would in the future ‚Äì but more thieves will keep trying to interfere with my business. Instead, what if you went back and told everyone my vault was impenetrable and I thoroughly defeated you? It would head off a lot of trouble. In exchange, I‚Äôll give you this.‚Äù She pulls a delicate ring from her finger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth more to you than the diadem ‚Äì after all, it‚Äôs part of how I have become such a famous thief. Goldenbeard is planning to take the diadem for himself, right? He‚Äôs still mad about our heist all those years ago. But this ring you can keep. Tell whatever story you like about where you got it, as long as it‚Äôs not from me. You get rich, I look strong, and no one‚Äôs the wiser.‚Äù

*Olseris agreed that Goldenbeard was furious about the diadem, saying Olseris harassed him about it often. He agreed to her offer.

*When asked what possessions of hers he had, Olseris said none. He admitted to having touched the glass case, but didn‚Äôt take anything.

*Lyriena gave him her Ring of Evasion, then she and her guards stood against the wall to allow him passage.

*He told her his name is really Olseris. Olseris walked calmly out.

*An invisible Fuzula slid past ever-quiet. Kereshi also slipped by invisibly without brushing anyone.

*As Enyo tried to sneak past unheard, Lyriena placed a hand on her invisible shoulder and whispered, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù After hearing ‚ÄúEnyo‚Äù whispered back, Lyriena said ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù and let her pass.

*Kereshi and Fuzula headed back to the Lavish Pumpkin. Olseris and Enyo, who had given their names to Lyriena, found an inn they could stay in for the night.

*Fuzula suggested storing the delerium in the Bear Sterling Mint and Vault as a very safe place. Kereshi had concerns that even the anti-magic field was still magic and may feed the delerium. They decided to sleep on it.

*The group slept until almost noon, as best Enyo could in her accommodations.

*Before heading back, Olseris and Enyo went to the Marred Casket & Tasty Mead tavern. Olseris asked if he could perform that night, free of cost, to practice some bardic material he has been working on. They said ‚Äòno‚Äô and that they weren‚Äôt concerned about pleasing the clientele. They did say they would allow Olseris to perform on the porch so long as he didn‚Äôt attract too much attention.¬†

*As Fuzula and Kereshi came downstairs, they found an unhappy Telliva waiting. An etiquette bow and a few silvery words from Kereshi had Telliva cracking up laughing.

*When Olseris and Enyo arrived and planned to order food, Telliva said there wasn‚Äôt time‚Ä¶Tragedy and Captain Winters were waiting for them. They grabbed soup to go, promising to return the bowls.

* You head into the West South Ward following behind Telliva. The small, well-maintained houses line the streets with many cul-de-sacs running off the primary streets. You are probably 25 minutes from the front gate. You travel along a street that is off the main throughway but still a significant lane, well-lit day or night.

¬†¬†¬† Hooking south, you enter a crisscross of small streets. Here you see young children playing in the yard under the supervision of their attentive parents. Your passing doesn‚Äôt seem to go unnoticed by anyone, although in your current company no one seems to question you. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt look on with questions. Telliva ignores them with his usual stoic focus. You don‚Äôt feel judged as much as observed. That‚Äôs not exactly right. You don‚Äôt feel prejudice, but the eyes are certainly judging if you belong here. You suspect this is a place that still looks out for their neighbors.¬† ¬†

¬†¬†¬† One house stands out up ahead; for more than one reason. For one, it is larger than most of the houses here, more of a mansion or small estate than a house. The barn, although small as barns go, is still larger than many of the houses. Seated on over 2 acres behind several other houses, the building is the size of a mid-sized inn.

¬†¬†¬† The house also stands out because it has clearly seen better days. Several windows are boarded up and thatch is placed on the roof to patch a hole of some kind in the wooden shingles. The main building, small barn, and 2 outhouses are maintained adequately; even the grounds have been kept up. But at some point in the past it was likely a battleground inside.

¬†¬†¬† Much to your surprise, Telliva turns up the walkway that leads up to the large house‚Äôs porch between two residences. A sign on the front reads ‚ÄúPaikalla‚Äù in a dialect of Common. An elderly woman in the backyard of one of the houses pushes her wispy hair out of her eyes as you pass.

¬†¬†¬† ‚ÄúNot causing trouble, are you laddie? You been around a lot lately. You leave that girl alone.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬† Telliva looks at her with an expressionless face, ‚ÄúMs. Lidel. If I cause trouble, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be the first to know. I thank you for your vigilance, just be sure not to rob others of their liberty either.‚Äù As she gives him a stern look, Telliva winks at her. Despite herself, a brief smile escapes.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†¬† Telliva begins his march toward the front door again. He says, ‚ÄúIf you ever move into this neighborhood, make sure you keep yourselves clean. They take pride in their neighborhood. The last owners of this place got it on the cheap and thought they could use it as a den to sell addiction. It was raided by the guard and peacekeepers soon after. These folk aren‚Äôt easily intimidated.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬† Pushing through the front doors, you enter a large room with a badly damaged bar. Clearly this was a tavern and/or inn, although there are clear signs that it was converted to one from a home. A young woman with fair skin, raven hair, and a long skirt sweeps the floor. She looks very familiar, although you don‚Äôt immediately place her. She briefly smiles, seeming to recognize you immediately. You hear Captain Winters voice come from the room on the other side of the double hearth. You hear intensity. He could easily be taken for upset, but you suspect it is just passion. ‚ÄúOh, come on. You can‚Äôt be serious. Not in this lifetime.‚Äù Ignoring the girl, the group moves into a room with a stage.

¬†¬†¬† As you walk in, Tragedy is just staring at him with a quizzical look. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt your jurisdiction. By Lovitar‚Äôs hand, it isn‚Äôt mine either‚Ä¶technically. But my squad has business here. And you have a job to do, also here. We wait.‚Äù

*The debate was just spinning up when the party said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll go. We don‚Äôt have anything to do after acquiring the delerium anyway.‚Äô

*Updates were given‚Ä¶

-The party recovered the stolen delerium.

---It will be turned over to law enforcement.

---The expectation is they will protect it rather than return it to the person it was stolen from.

---Enyo reminded them of the destructive nature of the material as it was shared by Averos. It is critical that they seek further guidance to make sure it can be stored safely and potentially destroyed if anyone can determine how.

-When the party was asked about the crime spree, Kereshi said it has ended.

---When asked how she can be sure, she said the person doing the spree is ‚Äúgone.‚Äù

---When asked who the person was, Kereshi claimed not to know her name (Fronda) but we ‚Äútook care of her‚Äù and reiterated she is ‚Äúgone.‚Äù Note: The party had told her she needs to leave town, but it could easily be construed as they killed her before learning her name.

---After a couple of sideways glances and figurative stuttering from Captain Winters, Kereshi said ‚ÄòOh, I don‚Äôt run around killing people, we only kill with consent.‚Äô

---Wanting to move on, Tragedy simply said to Captain Winters ‚ÄúLesser of evils, let‚Äôs move on.‚Äù

-Rhag and Marcus are still in custody. Although their presence isn‚Äôt critical, it would be better to have them present at the trial. Since it is a government corruption charge, the Rauha still have them in their custody.

-They have been able to gain insight into some timelines.

---Chief Inspector Farr has a leave of absence from his post for 1 year

---As fate stands, Chief Inspector Farr is expected to ‚Äúarrive at his destination in just over a week‚Äù

--- As fate stands, Chief Inspector Farr is expected to ‚Äúarrive in NuThornville in 3 months‚Äù

---They don‚Äôt know exactly where he is destined for or any intelligence on who he is meeting, but they know it is a keep in the Barbed Mountains (they know roughly where it is, but in mountainous terrain it will take some time to find).

---The party will be able to leave tonight rather than waiting until Tragedy could accompany them.

---Orein will accompany them across the Ravaged Lands. He is a scout and a Rauha Minor on Tragedy‚Äôs squad. During the trip, he plans to teach Fuzula a technique employed by expert military scouts in dangerous areas like the Ravaged Lands.

---The Rauha will be present to make an arrest if that is possible. Apprehending the chief inspector may also allow the squad to quit needing to keep Rhag and Marcus in their custody.

---Tragedy mentions one of his mentors who can cast a druidic spell called Wind Walk. If things go well, Tragedy expects him to be willing to cast it on the party.

*Tragedy, Telliva, Michael Winters, and Kereshi took the delerium to the place where sensitive valuables are kept for the city. It is protected by the same magic-negating spells as the Bear Sterling Mint & Vault and the top level prison. When at the doorstep, Kereshi handed over the delerium.

*The party purchased some standard equipment. The members of the party also purchased healing potions, two alchemist‚Äôs fire, and one use of Willowshade Oil.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 4 pm on Month 8/Day 2
