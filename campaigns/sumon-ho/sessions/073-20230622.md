From Don's email, discussion with Freddie after my time on "the walk"

No one currently has any information about the sword Kereshi carries.

After spending several hours going through the order's archives and his personal notes, transcriptions, and texts, Freddie says he didn't find much about the stones themselves. The Crimson Stones of Power were associated with the Abyss, a plane of evil and chaos. They were created there (or by a magical connection to its material) and can be used by powerful magic wielders to interact, draw from, or connect with that plane (and possibly its denizens). Freddie's research was mainly in ways to destroy something like them, more than the use of the stones themselves. The information about the Abyss came from one of his notes from his earlier research at one of the major libraries in [[Aimesville]]. The note mentions [[Stones of Power|Crimson and Emerald Stones of Power"]] but he didn't note anything about the emerald ones.

He says that it is possible the library at [[Sade Haukka Sanctuary]] in [[Rainsburg]] may have information on Dawnbringer since it is a weapon. If [[Lana]] allows, he could travel there and check, if you are concerned. It would take about 1.5 days to get there (Don would have to check this), so he couldn't be back for at least 3 days. But if Gwyn will be here that long, he could see if she would allow the trip. He has 3 or 4 other assignments that require library research, although he isn't sure how much Sade Haukka's archives will help with most of it.

(Eljas' mother is still at [[Sade Haukka Sanctuary]], waiting for Eljas to return)

Mountain Sanctum is roughly 4 days travel from [[Aimesville]], not counting the time it takes to climb down the mountain.

Gwyn would have liked to speak with Sutamo for some guidance, but casting Clairvoyance requires material components that I don't have access to.

Enyo was picking fruit with [[Selena]], where she was approached by [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]] to be eyes and ears for him. He keeps eyes on members of the [[Battle Mage Assembly]]. Enyo thinks that the information he wants is about the stones, and other important goings on.

Before bedding down for the night, I pulled Fuzula aside to talk to her about Kereshi's

I spoke with [[Lana]] about taking [[Freddie]] to [[Aimesville]], she was agreeable. We'll wait until [[Hun-Hoksa]] returns.

Day 2:

- [[Gwyn Hovey]] goes on walks again
  - Traveling with [[Daedove]] and [[Mordrin]]
  - Don says - [[Faithe]] has the ability to cast Clairvoyance and could probably tell me where to get one.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] helps cook
- [[Enyo]] works the garden on "the roof"
- [[Kereshi Khill]] helps repair a trail

By the end of the evening Gwyn is able to get his hands on the components

Kereshi is looking for information about Soulstriker and the [[Agents of Tloques]]

Just before the evening routine, [[Hun-Hoksa]] returns. Everyone freaks out and were excited to see her. She appears as a large horse with fine golden-brown scales. She sends telepathic broadcasts to her followers. She greets us (the party) by name, even Enyo.

Hun-Huksa compliments Kereshi on her sword, which makes both Kereshi and Dawnbringer happy.

Hun-Hoksa asks us to stay behind. The party, [[Leoris]], and the bald guy stay behind.

While she was telepathically speaking to us all, she was paying all attention to Kereshi. She asks her to lay down the sword, which he does. She calls  Kereshi the 'favored armsman' and talks about how Dawnbringer would ruin Kereshi eventually, and recommends that Kereshi not wield her.

She mentions another of the group might be able to resist the sword more readily.

Hun-Hoksa says - If it's a really hard decision, perhaps trading the scepter for Dawnbringer. Elinor does resist a bit, but eventually gives in. Kereshi is now wielding the scepter of eternal winter.

After this, I asked Hun-Hoksa about any insight into our decision.

She backs up our decision to visit the Putrid Lake, and says that it would be easy for us to misstep in "the Beast Lands" (aka Peidonmaa)

Enyo mentioned that she spoke with Jasper the day before, in the mountains. This piqued Hun-Hoksa's interest. She asked if Jasper bothered her.

We leave on the morning of the 3rd day with [[Freddie]], heading for [[Aimesville]]. (cinnamon roll out)

Hun-Hoksa loans us a "tri backpack" - which is a backpack that shares interdimensional space with 2 other backpacks, which we can use to get the stone that Hun Hoksa.

Enyo and Freddie go to search for the use of the stones of power, the crimson ones specifically, and if they can find info on what other stones.

- What other color of stones, do other colors do other things?
- Does "it" have an effect on non-living things?
- Is there any information that might point to whether the putrid lake or the beast lands

I dropped a letter off at the Dark House for Achilles then headed to the Exotic Object to see if I could get information on an a guardian emblem.

- Email Don with what the letter is, and how much the tithe is.
-
- The exotic object
  - has a portable crevace, which is basically a portable pocket dimension with stairs down
  - ring of swimming

Stephanie has the notes on all the money and things :O (Don will look to see if he can find it)

Next session we start the morning

>Session 73 (6/22/2023): A quick shuffle

Highlights

*The party learned that Hun-hoksa was going to return early since they were there. She will be back in a few days.

*The next morning the denizens and visitors of the Mountain Sanctum performed their assignments

*The party members…. Gwyn/Fuzula walked the trails with physic guardians and checked in on locals, Enyo picked fruit with Selena, and Kereshi practiced with Dawnbringer

*Enyo was approached by Jasper, the founder of her magic school. She has agreed to provide him with information she discovers during her travels and he provided her with a magical hammer. She will provide information by writing it on parchments and burning them in a special way.

*That evening she shared the information with the rest of the party. They were nervous about his intentions and if she was to spy on them although Enyo was being transparent. Everyone will see how it goes.

*That evening, Freddie provided information from his notes and texts: The Crimson Stones of Power were associated with the Abyss, a plane of evil and chaos. They were created there (or by a magical connection to its material) and can be used by powerful magic wielders to interact, draw from, or connect with that plane (and possibly its denizens). Freddie's research was mainly in ways to destroy something like them, more than the use of the stones themselves. The information about the Abyss came from one of his notes from his earlier research at one of the major libraries in Aimesville. The note mentions "crimson and emerald Stones of Power," but he didn't note anything about the emerald ones.

*Gwyn discussed Freddie accompanying the party to Aimesville, which would allow him to do some research about the stones and Enyo to help investigate information he was looking for. Superior Lana felt it was a win/win, as he would save several days of travel by leaving now instead of later; besides getting assistance from Enyo. They plan to wait until after Hun-hoksa returns.

*The next day assignments included Gwyn joining a walk again, Fuzula helping with the cooking, Enyo working with the topside garden, and Kereshi going to help restore a trail with steps and wood/rope railing.

*Hun-huksa returned that evening. Just before the evening routine, Hun-hoksa drifts down through the sky entrance. The energy by her disciples is contagious as they excitedly rush to welcome her, not to mention she is a magnificent vision. Hun-hoksa appears in her true form. You see a large horse with golden-brown scales. They are so fine they would probably go unnoticed at a greater distance. She has a long mane from the top of her head to the base of her neck of light brown, violet, and light green hair. Her beard and flowing tail are the same. A single horn protrudes from her skull. She greets her followers with ‘broadcasted’ telepathic messages; how much she missed you all, how much it is good to be back, and how the defense against evil continues in earnest. Her powerful body is impressive, but the piercing, intelligent eyes captivates even those who have seen her before. She descends to the platform, but doesn’t land on it. As she often does, she hovers a foot or so above the surface.

   Looking at the group of adventurers, Hun-hoksa greets you specifically. Welcoming each of you by name individually, including Enyo. As is usual, she often speaks broadly when in a group in order to include everyone. But she also has no problem keeping up many individual conversations at the same time without distracted pauses. It is customary for people to respond verbally unless the discussion is private.

*Hun-hoksa asked Kereshi and a few others to stay behind and talk. She asked her to put Dawnbringer on the ground at Kereshi’s feet. Then described that Kereshi was a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. Despite a lifetime emphasis on her physical prowess, if not because of it and balance, Kereshi’s mental abilities could not resist Dawnbringer. For this reason, Hun-hoksa highly recommended Kereshi give up the weapon while she could. Kereshi turned over Dawnbringer to Elinor, who turned over the Specter of Eternal Winter to Kereshi.

*Gwyn asked Hun-hoksa about her opinion of the choices for destroying the stones. She thought they were all equally challenging options, albeit different kinds of challenges. She believes they will be better off in a place where they can swing their weapons against evil challenges, rather than find themselves on a foreign plane of good beings where a misstep may make them viewed as the evil or murderous ones. So she felt the Putrid Lake was a good choice.

*The party was given one piece of a ‘Three piece holding,’ what amounts to three sacks that share the same extradimensional space. An item put in any of the bags can be removed from any of the bags. Nothing living can enter the bag, but it will allow people at the Mountain Sanctum to place the other stone in the bag once they successfully dispose of the two they carry; reducing the chance of losing multiple stones together but allowing more stones eliminated.

*Freddie and Enyo researched the whole day long; including the information on the Stones of Power the party needed, several topics Enyo wished to know about, and Freddie’s other assignments. It was a long day but a success.

*Gwyn looked for a Guardian Emblem (magic item) but didn’t find one at the Extraordinary blah <selling place>.

*Kereshi couldn’t find a magic weapon for sale, so he commissioned one. For his ring of jumping and 200 gp, he found someone who could provide a magic weapon in 6 weeks. He also had to provide an appropriate weapon. He bought a nicely made Great Axe and delivered it to the artisan.

*Fuzula hung out with Lem. He will keep on the lookout for a magic bowstring that causes fire.

*The party retired to the Fizzy Naval Bar and Tavern, where they have stayed before. In the morning, they plan to leave for NuThornville to find the map.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 8 am on Month 7/Day 15
