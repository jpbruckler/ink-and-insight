Gwyn has some alone time with the halberd, Kereshi snuggles up with the axe, and [[Enyo]] takes a nap on the chain shirt.

- 1200gp in a lockbox
- [[Enyo]] took the Hardy Chain Shirt
- Kerishi took the Handaxe +1
- Gwyn took Halberd of the Ice Lands
	- -3 to my AC

[[Tsakor]] keeps watch while we all get to know our new equipment.

We hop on the boat and head for the realm border, some 3 hours river travel away.

"As we get closer to the rapids, the water gets rougher. This rapids looks like it's back to the right side of the river. Yellow water splashes over the side of the boat as it rocks and the wood creaks under the strain."

Approaching the boundary, the fear and dread of the border crossing grow unbearable, Kerishi makes for land, we plan to walk across the border.

As we get within 10' of the border, we can start to see the dark outlines of rocks on the other side of the river. We all stand just outside the border.

Gwyn and Phallon muster the courage to walk through the border, and await the party on the other side.

As I walk through the border, I take 4 pts of psychic damage. I see Phallon wince at the same time that I do and grab his forehead.

As we exit the smoke barrier, the mental and emotional strain start to recede, slowly. We no longer are able to see the mountains on the right, as a thick wall of mist covers the land on the right side of the bank.

The left side bank is just a couple of inches above the river.

We can make out the borders of the Realm we stand in, as we entered the Realm at a high point. It is roughly triangular in shape, and we can see that the entire realm seems to be a giant bowl whose whole purpose is to contain the lake - what must be the putrid lake.

It's clear that the river has overflowed many times in the past. 

Most of the land has no light - like the other realms the light comes from the river.

The entire place smells of organic decay and fish.

We see some dead dudes (I lost some of the description), Gwynn is able to see that one of the dead guys has something shiny. These are within a mile of the lake. The largest of the 3 is missing the entire top of their body.

There are 3 large trees down by the lake. They look like willow trees, the trunk near the ground appears black and unhealthy. Further up, the tree looks normal, and is covered in fruit.

Within the bog itself, the land is dark, as opposed to the rest of the lands which are constantly giving off light, the light is smothered by the murky water.

On the way down, Phallon nearly fell 3 times - and I fell and slid quite a distance, taking 11 points of damage - 4 points of acid, 7 points of bludgeoning.

[[Enyo]] also takes a small spill also.

Phallon looks exhausted by the strain.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] walks up to the body holding the shiny thing. A humanoid skeleton wearing light armor is submerged partially in a pool. On its hand is a ring.

[[Enyo]] casts detect magic, the ring is magical, and is there a coin purse on the corpse Kerishi was messing with that's magic.

There's also some armor on the other corpse. Phallon and I head for the armor.

[[Enyo]] prestidigitates us all.

As Phallon and I make our way to the armor - this individual has been pulled apart completely, there's advanced levels of decay, even the metal equipment is pocked. The armor itself is scale mail, a deep brown/black color. 

It takes Phallon and I a couple of minutes to pick it all up. We take the armor back to the group, with the intent to put the pieces in the bag of holding.

[[Enyo]] notices we're being watched from the water. There's something in the lake with it's eyes just above the surface of the water.

A sleek body bursts from the lake in a spray of water. The body is 10' thick with a pair of short, stubby legs with webbed feet - but it's loooong. 30' in the air, and probably twice that in the water. It has a head too large for it's body, with cropped hair, and black tendrils 

(don says like a lizard + dachshund).

In Draconic, we here "Ah, thieves!"

I address Jat'ar Jom-Cee

We take one of the crimson [[Stones of Power|power stones]] to him, at his request and places it at the waters edge, as Jatar asks to inspect it. As he does, he eats it.

I throw in one of the stones, and even as it sinks, I can see that it's dissolving. As I watch it dissolve, there is a growing sense of peace within Gwyn.

We destroy 3 of the stones. In exchange, it costs me my cloak of the bat, and I trade the longsword +1 for black dragon scale mail.

We make our way back through the border, to get out of Jatar's realm. 


Session 84 (3/21/2024): Meeting [[Jatar-jom Sy]]

Highlights

*Upon waking in the morning, the party spent some time evaluating the items from the ooze. They were found to be a Hardy Chain Shirt, Halbert of the Icelands, a Handaxe +1, and an iron box with 1,200 gp.  

*Captain [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] expertly maneuvered through the next rapids, taking the group within a mile of the realm boundary.

*Piloting the craft to the shore near the boundary, the party approached it on foot.

*Gwyn mustered the courage to overcome the dread of passing out of the realm first. The entire party pushed themselves through.

*This must be the Putrid Lake. This entire realm seems to be a bowl with a swirling lake at its center. The sides lead down for 3 or 4 miles, not so steep to be unclimbable but steep enough that a fall may send you rolling all the way down. Along the sides there are many places where the ground plateaus for a few feet. Also, the sides of the bowl are pitted with tunnels and caves from 1 foot to 10 feet wide (or tall). Here and there you can see natural ruts where water has run down the side in the past.

   The ground does level off within a mile of the water’s edge, if you can call it that. While there is a body of water, all along the flat area are puddles and pools of the dark liquid. There are plenty of solid, if soft, paths to traverse. But it won’t be a straight shot. Notably, the vast majority of the flatter land doesn’t shed any light. There is sufficient light to see from the sides and the orb in the sky, but not the flat land. Three trees bearing a fruit like a small watermelon grow in the basin within a couple hundred feet of the shore.

   The lake itself is miles across. Its waters are murky and dark, reflecting the hillock from the other side on its surface. Despite the murkiness, currents can clearly be seen from here moving perpendicular to the shore; and in some locations away from the shoreline. The water seems to bubble in many places. On the bright side, the ammonia smell is all but missing from this realm. Unfortunately, the air instead smells of rotting fish and organic decay.

*Three corpses were below. [[Enyo]]’s Detect Magic spell gave her some insight. Magic items, a ring, coin purse, and a cloth were collected. [[Enyo]] realized a monster was watching while Gwyn and Phallon collected some scale mail.

* Suddenly, a sleek body bursts from the lake. Water sprays all around it as it rises up. You are not sure what kind of creature it is.

   The body is barely 10’ thick, with a pair of short stubby legs and webbed feet protruding 4 feet from the body. But it is long. The exposed portion of the body is at least 30’ in the air. You would imagine at least twice that is below the surface. Its head is large for the body, with cropped hair from behind its head to in front of its legs. With fangs the size of large daggers, powerful jaws, and long tendrils that fall behind its head, this…what…monstrosity, evokes fear in all that looks upon it.  

*The monster said, “So, thieves it is” in Draconic.

*Gwyn conversed with the creature, with [[Enyo]] joining in a little. Jatar was clearly not highly intelligent but was very powerful nonetheless.

*Gwyn asked Jatar-jom Sy where he should put his armor. He told Gwyn to bring it to the edge of the lake. Gwyn did and spent many tense minutes discussing who they were, why the party was there, and gaining permission to put the remaining two [[Stones of Power]] in the lake (after Jatar had eaten one).

*Jatar complimented Gwyn for being polite and seemed to appreciate his simple, straightforward [apparent] honesty. Jatar-jom Sy told Gwyn he could call him Jatar.

*Gwyn offered his Cloak of the Bat as payment for letting him dispose of the ‘evil objects’ in the putrid lake. They discussed that Jatar may get bored and eat him, so they ended their conversation.

*Before leaving, Gwyn asked if Jatar would want to trade the dragon scale armor for his magic longsword. While Jatar wasn’t worried about the fact that the armor was made of dragonhide, but since Gwyn was so polite he was willing to trade it. “I’ll never be able to wear it anyway. Ha ha.”

*The party possessed the following items they collected in the last 24 hours.
