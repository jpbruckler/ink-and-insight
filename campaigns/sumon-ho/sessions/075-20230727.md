## Session Log


It's 9pm. We are going to meet the kidnappers. Enyo will use [[Alter Self]] to appear as [[Monica Malcolm]] and take the ransom to the kidnappers.

We jot down a note for [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], hopefully the familiar will find her. 

We travel until we're about 5 minutes from the alleyway, we stopped so [[Enyo]] could cast her smell.

Amibound warehouse and shipping is our destination. It's in the center of the block, with an entrance facing east. There's a 10' wide alley on either side of the building

South of the warehouse is another warehouse, Ebberheim something or other.

there's 2 guys on a roof doing overwatch, and 2 people at the end of the alleyway. 1 of which is [[Estari Malcolm]].

Gwyn drops down out of the sky from about 4' up, then casts sleep, putting one of the assailants to sleep. 

I am o v e r w h e l m e d.

I try to bat cape tackle the running away guy, it failed. kereshi and i knock him out. The guards are coming, fuzula uses rope trick and we book it into rope trick.

Gwyn, having been called a murderer several times, is having a crisis of conscience while trying to walk away. Fuzula and Kereshi depart, Gwyn takes off his breastplate and packs it up in his cloak, doing his best to appear like a normal person.

Tsakor and Enyo got rooms in the Lavish Pumpkin.

Kereshi is at the Eyes Delight Tavern East

Gwyn shaves his head and will travel in town in the gambeson. 

Enyo and Gwyn 

Sending to Fuzula - May need you to meet with lt winters to tell your side so we can get access to the map. Are you willing?

Her response - Huh? OK!

Istari arranges for Lt. Winters to meet us at the Eyes Delight Tavern East.

Go to the Eye's Delight Tavern. Get directions from Kereshi. Don't let her leave.

Istari explained the kidnapping to Lt. Winters


Lt. Winters mentions Kipyanta (Finnish goddess of disease?)
