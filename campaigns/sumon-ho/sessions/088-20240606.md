^ put into Enyo's bag of holding

I grab some ichor with a glass vial and with a terrible arcana check, managed to get ichor all over my arm, the vial, and just everything. Enyo cast prestidigitation to clean up the ichor.

Kereshi touched the monolith and disappeared.

Enyo checked the monolith out and found there were some runes there in Abyssal (she can't speak it), and some in other, more archaic language. She does realize that there is a place she read about in the outer planes that uses Monoliths to transport between planes, and that the monolith is activated by touch.

The monoliths have different shapes, and those differently shaped monoliths take the user to different places (wide ones)

Fuzula listens to the explanation, then goes up and touches the monolith. Gwyn is next, Enyo was next, and finally Tsakor.

Upon touching the monolith, there's a weird sensation, the air smells of rotten fruit and it's very cold. It feels as though time is stopped, but eventually starts moving again.

Leaving the transport is a bit disorienting, some of us handle it better than others.

Cast sending to Olgann:

Mission accomplished. Back on the material plane. Any luck finding the demon:

[[Olgann|Olgann]] responds: "Nope. Hasn't been by here."

We learn that [[Nebeross]] had a mission to get someone for the Demon Lord.

We decide to go back to [[🗺️ Nuthornville]], by cinammon rolling over the mountain between the [[Demon's Door]] and that town. We travel for roughly 5.5 hours before needing to revert.

It's roughly around 7pm when I start making the Hut. I take a nap, then attune to the [[Scepter of Eternal Winter]].

We're about 1/2 way between the mountains and the border to [[50 TTRPG/51 Settings/Scalinea/Aimesland]].

Tsakor has somewhere to be. So we will cinnamon roll out all the way to [[🗺️ Nuthornville]].

We solidify about 5 miles out, and begin our final approach in our normal form. The road out of town is very busy. 

we stop a traveller and ask why it's so busy. He indicates there's a crime spree, and the gathering festival is over. 

We head for the Lavish Pumpkin once again. We see Michael "The Mace" behind the bar. His wife, Christina, was speaking was speaking with some waitresses.

[[Loren]] - busser
[[Tommy]] - errand boy
[[Prussira]] - waitress

The Mace points us to a table, and lets us know that Prussira will be with us shortly.

Prussira lets us know that there's rumors of crimespree, seems to be gang related. There's an octopus left behind at the crime scenes.

We get 3 rooms and some baths. 

I drop off my stuff in the room then hit the bath.

[[Tsakor]] lets me know there's a [[Sutamo]] ceremony in the next few days. 2 days before the new moon. I will join him.

After the bath, we decide to head to the Captain.

I swap the halberd out for the longsword, my shield, and wearing gambeson. After strapping on the sword, I get the feeling like it's more than just a longsword.

We then make our way to the Lieutenant to return the map.



Lieutenant Winters is the one that had the map. We go to his house. The gate is closed, there are 2 guards. We spoke to one of the guards (named Jim). 

- Jim confirmed Lt. [[Michael Winters]] was  promoted to Captain (yay)
- Cpt. Winters isn't home. Asked Jim to send a runner to the [[🗺️ Lavish Pumpkin]] when the captain returns.

After this, we continue our walk and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was actively looking for a town guard. She hails one of the guards to ask about the crime spree - pretending to be afraid of the criminal areas.

As we walk around it's clear the crime has had an impact on the town, less people are out than normal. Though we didn't see any indication of the crimes while we were out.

2 avenues for selling the Ichor
- Occultist shop
- Magical supply shop

About 20 minutes after we get back to the Lavish Pumpkin, the runner for the Winter family comes in, I get his attention and I arrange to meet with the Captain in the morning, just after light.

I ask [[The Mace]] for a place where to sell the ichor. [[Merlon's Mysterious Components]]. I will go there tomorrow.

- Fuzula concentrates on the shortsword.
- I concentrate on the longsword
- Enyo concentrates on the wand.

After concentrating on the longsword for a while, I hear a voice in the room that says "How do you feel about dragons"

The sword is called [[Dragonbane]]. We have some discussion about how it wants to kill all dragons.

[[Elizabeth]] is the overnight staff.

We get down to the common room with just enough time to eat. We get our food and head to one of the backrooms where Captain Winters is there. There are 2 guardspeople in the hallway.

Kereshi asks about her interaction with the guard last night, and that leads to the discussion about the crime spree.

The city is being terrorized right now. The Captain is concerned that there is an issue with people within the organization, and has permission to work with an outside party to get to the bottom of the issue. He hands over some files on the 11 events to be investigated.

The Roha are generally beyond reproach. So the [[Michael Winters|Captain]]has worked with [[Tragedy]] ([[Roha]]) to acquire the services of a Jr. Roha, and is able to provide bounty hunter licenses for us to cover "sticky" situations.

When did it start?
- Over the last 
- Murder happened after we left the town

Highlights

*The party put the newfound items in Enyo’s bag of holding, except Gwyn holds the diamonds to fuel Revivify spells if needed.

*Gwyn captured some of the demon ichor somehow caused but the tarry’s death. [I say “somehow” because tarry are daemons, not demons. It is a chaos plane.]

*Kereshi walked up and touched the obelisk, disappearing.

*After inspecting the obelisk and its ancient symbols, some of them old abyssal, Enyo remembered that there is a plane that used similar obelisks as portals. Obelisks wider than tall lead to the Abyss. Obelisks taller than wide lead to Hades. The rarest obelisks, equal in height and width, lead to other farther planes. She believes this to be similar.

*She also believed that a creature only required to touch the structure to be transported.

*The rest of the party touched the portal and were whisked away.

*Enyo appeared at the Demon’s Door first, falling into the dirt due to her disorientation. As she collected herself, Kereshi appeared…followed by others of the party.

*While waiting for Tsakor to exit the portal, Gwyn Sending a message to Olgann to let him know they had returned, were successful in destroying the stones, and to ask about if he had any trouble with the demon that was released. Olgann said ‘Welcome back. No, the demon hasn’t come here to bother me.’

*Returning to flying liquid form, the group flew over the mountain and headed back west.

*After camping near the midpoint of the Ravaged Lands, Gwyn floated the idea of walking back instead of always flying around. Seeing the world involves more than just flying from event to event.

*While Tsaker didn’t object to the rest of the party walking back, he wanted to finish in flight because he had an appointment soon.

*The party stayed together and ‘cinnamon rolled’ the rest of the way.

*They flew west until they passed the fort line and hit the main road between Aimesville and Pridesville. Turning north, they could see NuThornville 15 miles away. After a few more minutes, they landed off the road in cover to solidify.

*The road bustled with merchants, more heading away from the NuThornville than toward the city. *Getting some news from a passerby, they learned the Grain Gate festival had ended a couple days ago. He added matter-of-factly that the city wasn’t safe right now, so no need to overstay one's welcome.

*Fearing a rampant demon was causing trouble after being let free by Kereshi, [“No, not me, it was Gwyn.” Stop interrupting my recap, Kereshi]. As I was saying, fearing demon trouble after being let free, the party asked for clarity. The merchant seemed to be referring to a crime spree.

* You reach the Market Gate, as you did before. It takes almost 30 minutes to make it through the gate, much faster than last time. In this pass, no claims of Lordship are needed. You are given a quick look up and down, and waved past. Exiting the Gate’s guard chute, you find yourself anxious for the cooking of the Lavish Pumpkin. You had decided to stay there again. Anyone looking for you during your short stay would likely go there. That has benefits and risks, but the manager was fair and honest.

   Your trip to the inn is short. Walking in, you see Michael “The Mace” Mattel at the bar. He is the manager of this establishment. His wife, Christina, has apparently left her duties as the head cook to discuss something with the three waitresses. Tommy, the errand boy, is also listening intently. After a moment, the waitresses head to check on their customers. Tommy heads up the stairs, skipping 2 at a time.

   The Mace says, “Hey, welcome back. There is a clean table right there that will seat you. That other one still needs Oloran’s attention. Presyra will be with you soon”

- Oloran is the busser. A young half-elven lad. The waitresses today are Presyra (elven girl), Misty (human woman), and Argon (human man)

*Gwyn put away his halberd and strapped on the newly acquired sword. After doing so, he thought there might be more to the sword than a relatively common +1 weapon.

*After taking in some ‘real food’ and some baths, the group went for a walk by Lt/Capt Winters home.

*Jim the guard said through the gate that he did get promoted to Captain but he wasn’t home. Jim offered to take the map in return for a receipt, if they wanted to try back tomorrow, or if they would like a runner to let them know when he returned.

*Preferring to personally return the map, Gwyn elected for the runner.

*They took the long way back, enjoying a peaceful walk.

*Kereshi tried to talk to some guards about the crime, but they didn’t share any information, preferring to tell the local populace that they had things under control.

*Soon after they returned to the Lavish Pumpkin, a messenger arrived.

    -Captain Winters had returned home, but it had been a long day.

    -He would like to meet them in the morning just after sun up; either at his home or the inn.

    -If they must, he could meet tonight. If they must.

*The message was returned that tomorrow was fine. It was fine to meet at the inn.

*Enyo attuned to the Wand of Polymorph.

*Gwyn returned to his room and attuned to the sword. He and Tsakor heard a voice ask ‘what do you think of dragons.’ Dragonbane, the sentient sword, thinks all dragons are a threat no matter what they think their intentions are.  

*The next morning, the party met downstairs in advance of the appointed time to grab a meal.

*While waiting for their meal, Elizabeth (the overnight waitress and the manager’s daughter) said that ‘a Captain Winters is eating in the meeting room, from the city guard. He said to let you know when you arrived.’

*When their food arrived, the party headed into the meeting room where Captain Winters was looking through some papers while taking breakfast.

*Capt Winters welcomed them back and thanked them for returning the map. He was glad it was helpful.

*Kereshi, complained about rude guards from the night before and asked about the crime spree that they heard was gang related.

*Captain Winters said that he too would not normally go into much detail about the topic, but it so happened he wondered if they would be willing to help. There had been 11 events, associated by a squid-like graffiti; from malicious vandalism to a murder. Fearing there might be an informant of some kind in the guard, Captain Winters was permitted to seek out help that is not associated with the guard. *Yesterday: Due to being ‘beyond doubt,’ he requested Tragedy if he could use his services to escort the party (in case they need to enter a place law enforcement can go). Tragedy, the Rauha who escorted Kereshi from his room after his escape, agreed to let one of his Rauha minor assist for a few days. His name is Telliva.

*The party will be given “possession papers” bounty hunter license. This will give them some cover if violence happens, although just like law enforcement any serious injury will be investigated to ensure appropriate force was used. The bounty hunter license implies that the licensee has been vetted and trained to apprehend evildoers. Since Captain Winters didn’t want to provide their names, he will get them the version that the licensee is the possessor of the document. They are often used with deputized people or cross-service personnel. But it means that losing them would be a big deal and, frankly, shady people would want it if they saw it.   

*Captain Winters said that Lord Cummings offered to connect the assisting team with magic item sellers, investors, and traders. He wouldn’t have even mentioned it except he knows a relationship exists. If they wanted to talk to Lord Cummings, he would put them in contact. If they didn’t, he would say he wouldn’t allow it. The party agreed to meet with and receive the assistance.

*Captain Winters picked up his papers to leave with his 2 patrol officers. He said he would get Telliva with them as soon as they are ready to begin. He would also try to get Lord Cummings to meet with them later this afternoon.
