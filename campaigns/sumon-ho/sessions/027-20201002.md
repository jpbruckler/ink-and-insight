## Session Log

Where are we:
- [[Aimesville]]

- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] brought out his great axe and cut him down.
- Offering the name [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] kept her identity a secret while she spent the night in jail.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] headed back to their room and went to bed.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]], [[Bronson]], and [[Freddie]] headed back to the [[Home Comfort Inn]] for the night.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], I mean Regina, slept in jail to recover from his exhaustion.  
- The next morning at breakfast, despite no one having any idea where [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was, the party discussed their options. Ultimately, they decided to attend to other duties and decide whether to visit the [[Everson Estate]] or the building behind the [[Dirty Kitten]] tomorrow morning.
- [[Bronson]] went in look for a trainer to help him turn his experience in to solid techniques.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]. [[Elinor]] also bought a spell scroll of Bane. She couldn’t find a magic wand.
- Upon returning back to the Inn, [[Gwyn Hovey]] Hovey|[[ttrpg/Scalinea/Sumon-Ho/Gwyn Hovey]] Hovey|Sigmund]] went to the Kalevala campus in [[Aimesville]]. It has individual temples to [[Ilmatar]], [[Rondos]], [[Yipen]], and the god in waiting [[Diancecht]]. [[ttrpg/Scalinea/Sumon-Ho/Gwyn Hovey]] Hovey|[[ttrpg/Scalinea/Sumon-Ho/Gwyn Hovey]] Hovey|Sigmund]] visited his mother and worshipped at the temple.
- [[Elinor]] met [[Laidor]] at the [[Fizzy Naval Bar and Tavern]]. He was happy to see her and interested in her adventures. [[Laidor]] didn’t know anything about a “brotherhood” that called their members “Disciples”. He described the [[Dirty Kitten]] and a nearby building that is processed and shipped.
- [[Laidor]] said that the [[Dirty Kitten]] was a tavern and shop. They sell “frozen eggs,” a magic device that absorbs heat (keeping things cool).
- [[Laidor]] told [[Elinor]] about a “crafty” boy named [[Booster]], a “lad will do anything for a coin.” Among other things, he can identify magic items and forge documents. “He can be found off Humper-gruff Street in the alley between the Bathhouse the [[Exotic Object]], a store specializing in uncommon used items.” 
- Upon [[Elinor]]’s return to the Inn, the group ate dinner and shared what they knew. Then they headed to bed for the night.
- In the morning, they meet downstairs for breakfast.  

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 8 am on Month 4/Day 24
