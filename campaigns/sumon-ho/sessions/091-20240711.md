Meeting the magic item broker at Bear Sterling Mint & Vault.

Bear Sterling Mint & Vault
- Gwyn is aware of the name (due to history proficiency)
- 1 of 2 major banking institutions
- Coins used in Nuthornville are minted here
- Illegal to take weapons or armor


"Heather", a local hotty, and Lord Cummings' assistant comes into the Lavish Pumpkin to speak with us.

She mentioned that Lord Cummings was otherwise detained with a diplomatic responsibility, but he's trying to shake it.

There's a brief exchange between Heather and Fezula regarding the insights into the investigation. Heather seems fishy, Lord Cummings doesn't show up.

---

The next morning....

Captain Winters and a couple soldiers are in the common room when Enyo comes down. Captain wanted a moment to speak, and Enyo brings him back up to our rooms in the Lavish pumpkin.

Captain Winters comes up and Gwyn gives him a rundown of the investigation so far.

Found out Telliva is a fan of boiled eggs. I buy a couple from the Lavish Pumpkin before we head out.

Fuzula thought it would be a good idea to leave a note for Averos. I ask The Mace to let Averos know

---

Bear Stirling is a big building made from immense stones. There are no buildings adjacent. 

There are guards on the roof and lining the stairs.

The guards aren't necessarily intimidating, but clearly mean business.

We keep the weapons in the bag of holding until one of the Bear Stirling greeters asks us about why we're there. We give them the weapons, which are put in boxes. Telliva is only asked to tie up his weapons.

I give him his eggs.

As we step in, there is a Dispelling aura that cut off our attunement to our items. We feel kind of empty as a result. It's more a feeling of missing something.

We see Erabis at a table drinking tea.

There are archers on the 2nd level, and "BS" mages are walking around, which would indicate that magic is working, maybe?

We walk in to meet Erabis, who is sitting at a table, surrounded by bags.

Out of one of the bags he pulls the grimoire, belt, and other items the party traded. After inspecting the shortsword, he gets out 5 boxes with 5,896 gp each

Then gives 27,265 to Enyo for selling the wands.

Belt of Hill Giant Strength
Ring of Evasion
Javelin of Lightning
Arcane Grimoire +1

Erabis attunes to the Defender Shortsword, Enyo and Kereshi attune to their items and Tsakor attunes to his Ring of the Ram.

Don explains that other than in the private rooms, and some places high in the ceiling, magic doesn't work  outside of the rooms.

Erabis asks who our agent is, I let him know that he can reach out to The Mace, at the Lavish Pumpkin.

Then we head on to our investigations.

---

Telliva, Tsakor and I make our way to the other sites.

- The first site has the no full eye octopus
- Next site is the Feathered Peacock
	- She greets us, saying her name is Amanda and asks what event she can make special for us.
	- The group here
	- Amanda identifies us (Tsakor and Gwyn) as members of the church of Sutamo, and then shuts down, visibly upset. I cast sending to find out what the issue is, which is where she let me know about recognizing our necklaces.
- The other locations all seem to be related to the 2nd crew, the one that distracts

---

Kereshi, Fuzula, and Enyo make their way to the second alchemist, where some ruffians attempt to intimidate them. Kereshi attempts to intimidate back, with medium amount of success. The ruffians retreat, insulting Kereshi on the way.

Master Artisan Joel has hired some additional security due to the recent crimes.

The group speaks to the guard that answers the door. He mentions the people out front are there because one of the city council had died on their way back from Prideville, in the Jorenian kingdom.

---

Tsakor and I go back to the boyfriend/girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't recognize our necklace, but mentioned Tsakor looked alot like one of the perps.

Amanda says the people that did it, the half-orc was the only one wearing the necklace. 

The human of the group seemed to be the one calling the shots. The half-orc was mostly muscle.

Tsakor and I discuss how the half-orc that is in the distraction group apparently looks like Tsakor, which is what spooked Amanda. We agree to try to keep an eye out at the Gathering.

---

The Mace agrees to be our contact for Erabis and mentions he has no problem, since we tip well *wink wink*. I tip him 100gp.

---

We see Averos, and Erika (who was training the "new guy" the last we all met). There's a half elf in plate mail with a glaive. He wears a fancy sword at his hip.

The plate mail guy is quiet, even walking. 

We take Averos to the meeting room in the back of the Lavish Pumpkin. Erika joins us.

Averos says he's read the missing books. He said he didn't remember specifics in the books, but he remembered some of the information about the magi. He does mention that he's heard of delerium - not of this world. Could cause madness, and is a literal word killer.

It's a deep color with a purple hue. In larger quantities, it will flouresce.

It also gives off a vapor, that smells of a recent storm. Creatures that inherently magical can sense it, and are even drawn to it. It's been referred to as "magic condensate"

It will degrade the mental facilities at the least, and can cause organisms to mutate into abyssal forms.

The Magi book has some spell information in it (recipes) from the great Magi.

Averos says to be dealing with Delerium, you'd have to be doing some magical stuff, like some Warlock or some other.  The Equilibrium Brotherhood isn't the type of group that would be using this.

Averos says that Olgann is a weird one, and owes the SLD.

Averos didn't know off the top of his head a group that is active now that would be using it. He has heard a theory about how this element moves around. Essentially, delerium corrupts and as they do so it gets more and more dense until it finally causes a planet to implode - a multi-dimensional explosion - which spreads the material to other planets.

The dude in plate mail drops his disguise self, looking at Fuzula and Kereshi. It's Olseris - Averos

### Don's Recap

Highlights

*Heather, assistant and advisor to Lord Cummings, stopped by to see the party at the Lavish Pumpkin. Lord Cummings himself ended up being delayed and not making it.

*She was happy to hear Aribis was able to help them satisfactorily.

*She also asked some questions about what they had learned so she could update him if he couldn’t extricate himself from the “diplomatic…um… tussle” he was in. She also wanted to know if she or he could help with anything.

*Fuzula shared they thought there were 2 crews and asked if she knew what delerium was. Heather didn’t, so Fuzula told her they had reached out to some contacts outside the city.

*Fuzula and Kereshi both began to become uncomfortable with the questions.

*The next morning Captain Winters was at the bar when Enyo came down. They went upstairs to the group to brief him.

*He was annoyed that Heather, and Lord Cummings, were asking questions. He said he would need to figure out a way he could diplomatically tell Lord Cummings to stay out of the case. He told the party they should feel free to tell the Lord and his assistant that they were scolded for sharing information with him and they cannot any more.

*The party shared most of what they learned with him; from the 2 crews to the missing delerium.

*A few hours after sun up, they arrived at Bear Sterling Mint and Vault. Gwyn knew from history the man Bear Sterling was an old financier and the company Bear Sterling shapes gold ore into gold pieces for the city. It is also a full service financial institution.

*Within most of the building, magic doesn’t work. Items cease to be attuned and fail to function. An exception is within the confines of the eight rooms along the north wall.

*Aribis Psicon could be seen at a small table in a meeting room drinking from a tea cup. He had several bags containing some items and gold.

*In addition to their items, each party member received a box with 5,896 gp in it. Enyo also received over 27k in gold for a Ring of Warmth, Wand of Web, and Wand of Polymorph.  

*Telliva took Gwyn and Tsakor to the remaining crime sites. Only one of them had information of interest and all of them appeared to be from the ‘noise’ crew.

*At “The Frilled Peacock,” a small group of citizens and their hostess, Amanda, were assaulted by 4 thugs. Amanda was there and willing to show them around.

*She was struck by traumatic fear when she thought she recognized one of the assailants in Tsakor, especially when she believed Gwyn might be from the same gang.

*Enyo, Fuzula, and Kereshi visited the shop of Master Artisan Billy Joel. Although a master artisan, he was pretty much a dumpster fire. Full of anger, greedy, and not a very good parent. But he did have an affordable Oil of Slipperiness that Fuzual bought.

*And Enyo might have been able to make an honest dwarf out of him. ;) But she resisted his…well…”charms.”

*The party reassembled at the Lavish Pumpkin. Gwyn, via Sending, checked on the progress of Averos, who had recently arrived in the city and was an hour from arriving at the Lavish Pumpkin.

*   Through the window, Fuzula and Gwyn saw a familiar half elven face approaching the building. You almost missed him, as you have never seen Averos in armor before. Gwyn doesn’t recognize any of his companions, but Fuzula and Kereshi will. Not the two walking a step behind him, but they have seen the serious looking woman wearing a buzz cut and scale mail who trails behind several steps. Erika was her name.

    A step behind and to his right, a high elf in wizard robes strolls in tow. His attention wanders but he keeps up with Averos. To his left, a half elven warrior walks nearly in step with Averos. Wearing plate mail and carrying a glaive, he catches the attention of many passersby. Having seen many tools of war yourselves, it is the beautiful sword sheathed at his hip that stands out to you. It is a magnificent cross-guard on a short but crafted pommel. The blade is the length of a longsword, but the handle is more like a masterpiece scimitar.

*All but the mage joined them in a conference room. Averos said Eric (security detail leader) was replenishing provisions with the rest of the detail.

*About delerium Averos said, “Yes, you mentioned delerium. I have done extensive research on…well…a lot of things. I know of one element called delerium, but I’m not aware of it being here on our world. Hopefully it is just a name collision. That is some bad stuff. If you’re lucky, it will only cause you to lose your mind. It can be a world killer.

“Delerium is a magical element of unknown origin. It is a deep purple hue, but light sheens off of it in small quantities. In larger quantities, it will give off its own light. The color is hard to describe. It also gives off a vapor, not terribly important in small quantities but in larger quantities or enclosed spaces it can be a problem. It smells of a recent storm, and can cause the hair on your arms to stand up like preceding an electrical storm. Creatures that are inherently magical, including many spellcasters, can sense the stuff. And it is alluring to them. It is a magical element, in one case referred to as ‘magic condensation.’ Just don’t take that too literally…at least I don’t think you should.

“Delerium will cause degradation and mutations in creatures that come in contact with it, as it is absorbed into the skin. Even the vapor can be altering over time. At a minimum, it will degrade the mental faculties like a powerful drug or other toxin. But it can also mutate a creature into an aberration.

“It responds to magic. It can both enhance and negate magic, depending on its use. It glows in the presence of magic or moonlight. Its crystalline state divides over time, causing it to grow. This division happens more quickly in the presence of magic, which is where I think the condensation idea comes from. But over centuries it can cause irreparable damage to a world. Hopefully, what you’re hearing about is something that happened to be named the same.”     

*After Averos’s description compared to Master Artisan Ilstim’s description, the party informed Averos that this seems to be the same material.

*Averos has read The Gods among Us: Legendary Magi. While he has been told the Advanced Spell book had only rough spell information, the other book has actual recipes of these legendary magi.

*Averos is perplexed how a small quantity would have arrived on this world. No one really knows where it comes from, but one theory is that it eventually causes a world to explode in a multi-dimensional event. Shards distribute among worlds throughout the plane and maybe beyond. This starts the expansion process again. If that theory is accurate, there should have been more of the stuff.

*Averos is pretty sure he has never read about a way to destroy it. In a world that doesn’t have this blight, that information was probably not valuable. He suggested the only chance of finding it is through entities that are not totally tied to this world.

*Averos and Erika go to eat. The warrior in plate mail stayed behind with ‘his friends.’

*The warrior dropped his Disguise Self invocation. He said he was Olseris. Kereshi didn’t believe him, since she knew he was dead. Olseris said Averos resurrected him. Olseris is obligated to serve him for a year, but he is happy to do it. He is just glad to be alive.  

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 7 pm on Month 7/Day 29

### Postlog - Sutamo Gathering

After the disappointing information from Averos, the drizzle that began as Gwyn and Tsakor stepped out of the Lavish Pumpkin seemed the right fit for the mood. The pair would have likely raised their hoods before getting to the Mutts Inn and Tavern, but as the rain steadily increased they donned their hoods before even traveling 10 blocks. Tsakor wore his corroded breastplate, his magical hand axe at his back waist, and his ever-present dagger in his left boot. He wore a well-worn traveling cloak, but most of his valuable equipment was in extradimensional items carried in his sling bag. By the time the pair reached Mutt’s, they must trod through puddles 3 inches deep. At Mutt’s back door, a glance the way they came showed a hooded figure. There will be a lot of them in this alley tonight, so it was worth noting but not reacting to this night. Tsakor grasped the handle and they stepped in.

They stood in a hallway with the non-church equivalent of an Enforcer. Not only did he share Tsakor’s role in the church, he looked strikingly like Tsakor. The key difference being a tattoo on his left forearm toward his body. It looked like a black battle axe on his forearm with the end of the handle at the crook of his elbow. An inked cord went from the handle and wrapped around the bottom of his bicep in red and grey. As is customary, Gwyn and Tsakor lowered their hoods so the doorman could see their faces. While privacy is important, no one entered without someone recognizing them. Tsakor said, “This is Gwyn, the guest priest I assume you were told we have the privilege of sharing this evening with.” The enforcer-for-a-night said with little emotion, “It is my honor to let you pass, sir.” Gwyn believes him, even if he isn’t elated. Of course, Gwyn isn’t really sure why someone would be elated at his mere presence. Hearing the door opening behind them, the pair climb the spiral staircase to their right.

Climbing the steep staircase, both peered down at the arrival behind them. There was a slight tilt of the head as if he was waiting for the footfalls to stop, then, apparently deciding there was nothing to worry about since they passed the doorman, the half-elf pulled off his hood. He shook his green hair as water splashed around.

   “Evening, Rhag. Beautiful night,” he said jokingly while stroking his hair.

   “Yeah, Peren. Glad to be indoors tonight,” the half-orc replied.

As the stairs ended 12’ up, a landing allowed entry into two rooms. A coat rack stood nearly empty; apparently only one person didn’t want to keep their cloak with them even wet. Activity can be heard through the right door. Inside is a room with tables side by side set in a row. All the chairs face in one direction, except a single table at the front of the room. The curtains over the windows are closed tight. A few potted plants that look like little trees are set about the edges of the room.

Gwyn is surprised to see the number of people. The Darkhouse has almost 90 members of the church, 45 of which are active members. This room has almost 20 people in it, and it is still a few minutes before the Gathering begins. That is nearly half the size despite no formal church…almost too big. Several folks are standing in clumps talking with friends and acquaintances they haven’t seen in a few months. After the worship, there will be more socializing. Now it is primarily people catching up with old friends.

 As Gwyn looks around, Alexander spots him and waves a greeting. “Good evening, Gwyn sir. You can either sit at the front with me, although I’ll be standing most of the time. Or you can sit in the first row. We’ll get started in a few minutes.”

 "Thanks Alexander, I'll take a seat in the front row, for now. If you'd like me to say a few words near the beginning or end, please feel free to introduce me." Gwyn chuckles, then adds "Honestly my talents don't lie in public speaking, but we must do as we are called, even in front of a gathering this size."

 Tsakor said, “I see my spot over here.” He strolls over to a plant 15’ from the door and leans against the wall. Gwyn thinks, always the enforcer.

 Gwyn takes a seat and uses Sending to message Tsakor: "I'm sure you made note of Rhag. If Enforcers ever talk amongst each other, it might be worth trying to see what he's about." Tsakor responds, “I’m sure he’ll come up here. Might get a few words during worship, but likely wait until social time.”

 A few at the Gathering still wear a hood over their heads. It is there right to maintain their privacy, so long as they were viewed by the doorman (or in special circumstances, another appointed member). It can be unnerving to discuss church business when you don’t know for certain who’s in the room, but honoring participants’ privacy is paramount. Besides, in NuThornville there isn’t much church business to discuss. 

A few minutes later, Alexander walks around the room covering the 4 lanterns and then takes a seat at the table facing the worshippers. The room is dimly lit with two candles on each end of each table. Most people begin to take a seat. Alexander, of course, does not demand people stop there conversation. Everyone has come here to worship and therefore it benefits everyone for us to begin. Everyone will quiet to begin soon. For the few stragglers who are engrossed in conversation and therefore don’t notice the growing silence around them, a loud clearing of Tsakor’s throat makes them realize everyone else is waiting on them. Someone nearby would have gotten their attention if needed, but none of the congregation wanted to hold up the worship. As the room quieted down, Rhag climbed the stairs and took a position just inside the door. In addition to being the doorman, he serves as the inside guard.

Alexander stands, speaking in a loud and assertive voice, placing a beautiful short sword on his table to represent the presence of their deity. Symbolic but without a keen edge, Alexander brought this holy object from his days as a Deacon. “Welcome to all who have come. Tonight, two days before the third new moon, we join in spirit and body to give stalwart worship to Sutamo, Keeper of the Night. May we earn his blessing by demonstrating diligent work ethic and a willingness to learn the skills needed to fully utilize that blessing.” He continues on with the worship service. The first several minutes is roughly scripted; the leader of the worship can take some liberty with the script but the flow is well understood.    

Four times a member steps forward to read from the Book of the Diligent. You hear stories of faithful acts of defiance, exceptional work ethic, and victories accomplished indirectly without combat necessary. Alexander then tells a story tying the readings together in a way that most of the congregation can relate to. Then he says, “Before I end my sermon, I’d like to introduce a priest visiting from Aimesville. Gwyn is a priest there. Please make him and his bodyguard, Tsakor the enforcer, feel at home. If you have religious or morale questions for Gwyn in private, there is another room available across the platform; or you can ask if his schedule allows a separate meeting. But for now, I give the floor to Gwyn to share anything he would like with the congregation. Gwyn, sir. It is yours.” Alexander sits down.

Everyone intently listens. While not exceptionally charismatic, the mix of persuasion skill and Gwyn’s natural ability to read people allows him to deliver an engaging and informative speech. Gwyn focuses on an individual vs the whole group, but has learned to just move that focus from person to person. This process makes the whole congregation feel like he is talking to them directly. 

Gwyn begins, "I admit I'm taken aback at the number gathered here in worship of Sutamo; pleased, of course, but surprised nonetheless. It speaks to the good works that Alexander and those in this group who have been called to lead have done. I have lived a life in service, but also in motion; my travels throughout the realm have demonstrated to me that the need for protecting those who would be oppressed, for standing steadfast in the face of tyranny, is as great now as ever it has been. Our members come from many walks of life, Sutamo welcomes us all; rogues, ruffians, bakers, millers, those skilled with the hammer, the pen, and those skilled with the blade. It is upon all of us to demonstrate a thoughtful stubbornness in bettering ourselves, in bettering our skills, and in so doing lifting those around us."

Gwyn continues, "NuThornville is not without its problems" (and here Gwyn will let his focus settle on Rhag for a moment before moving on to other faces in the group) "I have heard of a string of transgressions both big and small, murder, theft, vandalism, beatings. What troubles me the most about these are the plain folk that are impacted? The couple who don't even have the coins to rub together for their own oven, but their apartment and all their belongings were ruined with paint and stained with oil; the young couple who were beaten in the street, the young lady receiving a broken leg. She'll be unable to contribute to their livelihood for several weeks, putting them in danger of losing their apartment. I bring attention to these acts because when many people think if tyranny, they think of big acts - the evil king; the slaver; - but miss the oppressive force that poverty can be, they don't stop to consider how many of their neighbors are a bout of sickness away from being forced out into the street by the tax man and the land lord. If I can impart one thing upon all of you, it is to try to be mindful of the smaller transgressions that get in the way of ones' freedom."

After Gwyn speaks, Alexander stands again and thanks him. After a bit more ceremony, everyone comes forward in a line, bows before the short sword (representing the presence of Sutamo), silently lays their need before him (Sutamo), and returns to their seat. After a final hymn is sung, Alexander thanks Gwyn for his “inspiring message.” Most of the Gathering worshipers pound on the table or stomp their foot in agreement; while a handful simple clap.

The final activity of the worship is to recite a poem. It asks for Sutamo’s blessing, the freedom to pursue one’s passion, and deliverance from oppression. During the poem, four members move to the lanterns. The last two lines are “If it is beyond my skill to escape a tyrannical life, Give me the courage to give up life rather than relent.” On the words “tyrannical life,” the lanterns are uncovered.

Alexander says, “May freedom always be your companion.” With the worship ended, Alexander and a few others of the congregation come to shake Gwyn’s hand and thank him for attending. While this is happening, Tsakor approaches Rhag at the door. Tsakor says, “Hello. I’m Tsakor, Enforcer of the Darkhouse. I feel like we are kindred spirits. You perform some of the same duties I did for years there. It has been a while, as I have been on assignment for a few years.” Tsakor makes small talk, mainly. Building a little rapport and asking about the city (i.e. favorite places to eat, enjoyable things to do, upcoming events or tavern shows he might recommend). Basically trying to learn a little about him and potentially know where he might be found if Rhag exits before we can talk to him. Not wanting to push too much, Tsakor says “and Gwyn is a down to earth priest. If you have any questions, I know he will make himself available to talk to you. I’m sure you want to socialize, so I’ll let you go about it. Hopefully we can talk more later or maybe even show me around. Tomorrow is expected to be my last day in the city so I don’t want to waste it.”   

   Tsakor briefly relays to Gwyn that Rhag lives in one of the sparse houses in the East ward with 6 other people. He works as a laborer, and Tsakor got the impression he doesn’t have steady work. He mentioned a bard he likes who is playing in 2 days at the Big Fin bar. Tsakor tries to pay attention to which people Rhag interacts with; who might be his friends or at least know him outside of the Gathering.

   Gwyn had nonchalantly mentioned the doorman to a few people. He hears that Rhag has a strong work ethic but hasn’t found blessings beyond his minimal needs. He is faithful and dedicated to the doorman role he volunteered for a few years ago. He is attentive, but takes a while to warm up to people. Like many that find their way to Sutamo, he is a survivor. Not much impresses him, which can be a good quality for an enforcer (not enamored easily).

   While Rhag does look over at Gwyn a few times as if he is considering approaching him, he doesn’t. The social time typically lasts for an hour. Afterwards, if there were some guests (or potential recruits) to the church another separate worship would be held in which all of the members would wear hoods. But there is no ‘guest worship’ today. So three or four of the groups of worshippers are going to retire to nearby taverns for a nightcap after the social hour is over.

   As the social hour has come to an end, a half dozen or so members have already left early. But most, including Alexander and Rhag, stay until the end. With about 10 minutes left, Alexander begins collecting paraphernalia; putting candles into small bags and tying them into a larger bag. Even the beautiful short sword goes in the bag, whose strap allows it to go over a shoulder across the body. Gwyn and Tsakor help pick up. Alexander asks if they plan to continue to socialize, but they both say they still have other business to attend to this night.

   Rhag and 2 other lads go downstairs to the back door with Tsakor on their heels. The members normally leave in groups of 3-4 every couple of minutes or so, enough to be safe while not too many traveling together. It would look to a typical observer as if small groups of people happen to be leaving the bar for the evening. When the first 4 members ready to leave reach the bottom of the stairs, one of the lads dons his hood, steps into the alley, nonchalantly crosses it, and relieves himself on the wall. Looking up and down to ‘make sure no one was watching him pee in public,’ he leans his head on his arm against the wall. This is the sign that the coast is clear.

   The 4 members step into the alley and head south. The peeing lad strolls north when he is finished. Three others step out and catch up with him. Other groups assemble in a bit of a gaggle at the door in small groups. A few times, Gwyn is asked if he would like to go next. He declines.

   About the middle of the members’ exit, Alexander says goodbye to Gwyn with a firm handshake. Gwyn and two members head downstairs with him. Alexander, the two members, and the other lad doorman nod to Rhag and head out the door. Tsakor, Gwyn, and Rhag have just a moment alone before the next group descends the stairs.

   Gwyn asks, “When do you leave?”

   Rhag says, “Shortly after the last group.”

   Gwyn says, “That will be us.”

   Soon after that, three members come down the stairs with the announcement, “We’re it. Last group.”

  Less than a minute after the last group, Tsakor says, “I’ll take outside guard.” He pulls his hood tight against the drizzle’s return, shuffles across the alley, then slumps in a doorway as if he is bedding down for the night. The darkness doesn’t bother him.

  Gwyn says, “Before we depart, I have been meaning to speak with you. I hope you don't mind, I asked Tsakor to get a feel for you.”

  Rhag says, “No, Priest. It’s OK. I will say, it sounded like you were talking to me personally from the stage. Your message hit home.”

   “I’m glad it was impactful.” Gwyn continues, “You see, as Tsakor likely mentioned, he'll be leaving my company in a day’s time, and I find myself in need of a companion. I wondered if that might be something you would consider? The pay is lousy, the hours are terrible, you'll also be traveling with a group of adventurers I've aligned myself with. I won't lie, I'm on a dangerous path, you almost assuredly will be hurt, and will definitely see battle."

   Rhag stares at Gwyn for a few moments. “I’m not sure what to say. But I can’t leave my crew. I try to keep them out of too much trouble. We should be coming into some money, probably tomorrow night. So I think I’ll stick around here.

   “About your compelling homily, sir. I bet those vandals couldn’t imagine 8 roughneck acts could cause that much fear, even with a death…which I’m sure the theoretical crew knew nothing about,” Rhag says with a slight smile. “Your comments about poverty are heard. The crew might not have had the resources to do their business without getting caught targeting up the ladder very high. But I’ll think about what you said.” 

   Rhag peaks out the door at Tsakor, who looks asleep. “Time for you guys to go?”

   Gwyn looks at Rhag seriously. “Yes, we do need to be on our way. One last thing. I'm certain, as you say, the vandals knew nothing about the greater crimes being committed beneath the chaos they were sowing. My traveling companions are looking for information on the group carrying out the more serious crimes. If you hear anything that might help us with the other group, please ask Alexander to send me a message asking me to stop by here. The vandals really are of no concern, especially in the light of what it seems like the other group has planned. I only mention this as I hear you take on the odd-job or two, and maybe you'll hear from someone with loose lips.” Then with the look of sincere hope, “Be well Rhag, blessings of Sutamo upon you.”

   Rhag nods, “I promise to consider what you have said. Maybe we’ll meet again soon.”

   With that, Gwyn steps out the door. Tsakor is immediately wide awake and rising to his feet, a bit soggy but alert.

 Upon returning to the Lavish Pumpkin, Gwyn thanks Tsakor for his support last night, and all the last couple of weeks. Gwyn writes a letter to Achilles; a brief summary of our journey so far, the destruction of the stones, meeting Sutamo, some good words on Tsakor's performance, and information about the group in NuThornville being led by Alexander. In the morning, Gwyn gives the letter to Tsakor who had agreed to deliver it to the Darkhouse. A caravan leaves for Aimesland at 10 am. Tsakor plans to catch it unless Gwyn can spare a use of the Wind Traveler spell.
