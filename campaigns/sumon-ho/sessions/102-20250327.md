I ask Orein about giants in the ravaged lands. He says that there are several giants in the area, some Hill Giants, some Mountain Giants.

I cast Druidcraft and am disappointed to see that we're likely in for a wet day.

Throughout the day it keeps raining. I pull my cloak tighter around me.

As we transition from plains to trees, Orein stops, focusing on something ahead of him. We stop, keeping Orein about 50' ahead. He shakes his head, apparently deciding he was being silly, then proceeds into the trees, with us behind him.

As we move into the copse of trees, Orein head snaps to the left in surprise as a large Lizardman steps from behind cover, towering over Orein.

Reptile, standing on 2 legs. Like a large version of a raptor, standing about 12' tall. (They were Allosaurus')

After the battle, the rain relents for about half an hour, before starting up again.
