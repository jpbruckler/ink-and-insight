## Session Log

- The plane the putrid lake is a warm, humid place (in the 80s). There is no door on this side of the portal, a not exactly comforting fact.
- We head off, roughly 60 degrees from the monolith, towards some mountains.
- As we travel, there is a "blob" that is obscured far too our left, it looks like fog. The non-descript formation appears to not be impacted by the blustering winds, continuing to appear as though in a haze.
- As we make our way along, we pass intentionally dug pits. the dirt from the digging can be found beside them. They appear to be graves.
- We pass by an unusually high hill, 20' tall. Fuzula and Kereshi head up the hill.
	- The monolith is 2 miles behind us at this point
	- About 5 miles ahead of us, they see a roughly square building with a stream, leading to a river.
	- They get a good view of the humanoids in the distance - one is missing an arm, the other missing a large chunk from their neck - they can only be described as zombies.
	- To the left, there are 4 monstrous, insect-like animals are flying towards us. They're about 9' long from their mandibles to th
- As Enyo and I talk, we're rudely interrupted by a bounding Kereshi.
	- close to us is a series of boulders, a short hill is about 100' away, and the 20' tall hill.
	- We decided to try to hide behind the boulders
		- we see a grave behind the boulders
- 3 of the 4 beetles fly by, the 4th stopped and started heading our way, likely seeing Tsakor's helmet. The 4th turns to head our way, the other 3 turn as well
	- Fuzula missed her first 2 attacks - taken at disadvantage :O
	- Tsakor hexed one of the hellwasps, then attacked with his sword, striking and causing both ice damage, and inciting fear in the heart of his foe
	- Gwyn actually hit something with his sword :O
	- The Hellwasps took no damage from the fireball
	- Gwyn was paralyzed by a sting, and the last hellwasp tried to fly away with him. Fuzula struck the hellwasp down, saving me from being a spawn point for the next generation of Hellwasp
	- We take a short rest.
- There is a crevice in the ground ahead of us, we hear loud angry murmurs coming from the crevice. There are boulders near the crevice. A very tall humanoid with a greatsword on his back, telling us to move on, nothing to see.
	- Fuzula hears a voice yelling up from the crevice that he wants his sword
	- Kereshi approaches the crevice to talk to the tall humanoid.
		- The humanoid identifies himself as the Jailor.
		- We notice a wight crawling out of the crevice.
		- Gwyn convinces Kereshi to move on
- We're getting closer to the square building - 250' to 300'
	- There are 6 - 8 undead heading towards us, off the trail to the left.
	- We notice another group of undead heading towards us up the trail from behind, clearly tracking us
- We pick up the pace heading towards the building.
	- The first building we've seen since entering the demon's door. along the right side is an unusual amount of vegetation. L shaped building. 40' wide, 100' long. There are 4 towers with sentries in plate mail; they aren't paying us any mind.
	- There are a pair of large doors in the front, 15' tall. Stained windows - left side stained glass has a depiction of a muscular man standing among the dead, with a 3 headed wolf.
	- Several other stained glass windows depict things.
	- Neither Enyo nor Gwyn are able to recognize any particular deity 
	- Kereshi decides to head into the building
	- The sentries don't seem to care about us
- Kereshi pushes the door about half open. Much of the interior is 1 big room. Near the left hand corner are 2 bodies, killed. 12 columns depicting humanoid warriors of all kinds of races. There's a throne at the end of the hall, 2 dire wolves lie among a group of wolves.
	- The wolves stand and bare their teeth, but are held back
	- A humanoid over 6' tall moves to the center of the hall. He appears more wolf than human.
	- Another man, a half-elf steps into the great hall. His cowl is pulled up, hiding his chin and neck.
	-  Nuroempi - is the name of the wolf-man. Steward of Death Hall.
	- The half-elf says "The prince doesn't like bodies in here like that" (half elf is named Ajax)
	- The chapel is for Surma, the Prince of Death, Marshall of Pain, Harvester of Lives, Deliverer of Peace.
		- Gwyn gets a ladle full of blessed water from the basin (and so does Kereshi)
			- After drinking the blessed water, there is definitely a "feeling"
		- The steward indicates that if we leave the undead alone largely. 
	- Gwyn talks to Ajax about how he (Gwyn) died and then came back. Ajax says that he died a couple of times and came back, and became a worshipper of Surma, and once he died for good he came to serve in the Chapel.

>[!info]
>When I see Ajax, I recognize beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is dead - not undead, but dead. I'm certain he's the physical manifestation of the spirit of a departed soul.

- Enyo asks about hazards.
	- Ajax says
		- Don't get into the lake
		- Getting lost in the swamp is bad, mmkay.
		- The Storm Trail is the safest way
		- Any travel now is a dangerous time. Demons have established a foothold in the area.
- Serma and the Undead
	- The Vogels have taken over the church in Baston. 
	- Serma has no like or dislike undead. They can be used.
