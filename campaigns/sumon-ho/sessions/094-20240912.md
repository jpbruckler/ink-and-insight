- Planning to meet Fronda
    - See session 93 recap for Fuzula's gathered info
    - Seems like Fronda might be willing to give info if approach is right
        - We're adventurers, not cops, we want info not to get her in trouble
        - Warn her that she might be a loose end
        - KereshEnyo will come but stay back
        - Fuzula will be closer + invisible  
              
    

- Meeting Fronda
    - Fuzula guides us to the sewer tunnel she followed Fronda into
    - We each get down the rope and through the gate no prob
    - Tunnel has a channel running through middle; 4 ft wide; catwalk higher up
        - Enyo take the catwalk, Fuzula follows on ground, KereshEnyo stops @ midway
        - Enyo come across a 3 ft offshoot tunnel; Fuzula tells me this is where she followed Fronda
        - Enyo go into the tunnel and find a blanket covering a hole that leads to a room
- Room is 10 ft across, 30 ft long, probably an old maintenance room
    - In right corner: some blankets, pitcher, elderly lady trying to catch a cricket
    - In left corner: some furs, a pitcher, a human foot pokes out from the furs
    - Near the lady, on the wall, is what looks to be a tool rack
    - Near the foot, more to the middle, is a box with a birdcage, in the birdcage is a pet rat
        - Given what Enyo know about IRL rat owners, that might explain why she threw the rock at the cat and was happy to hit it
    - To my immediate left and right, there are shelves on the walls
        - The shelves have what look to be parts/tools for sewer maintenance
        - The shelves to my left seem to sometimes get wet
    - Enyo don't perceive much about the room aside from what Enyo can see (lol)
    - Enyo decide to investigate by talking to the person under the furs
        - As Enyo get close, the person throws off the furs, seems afraid, says he doesn't have anything
        - Being the socially awkward creature Enyo am, Enyo just straight up ask if he's seen his friend Fronda
        - The man glances up at the wall behind me, but claims he doesn't know a Fronda
        - Enyo give him a unit of rations
        - Enyo walk over to the woman and also give her some rations, she is excited to get them
        - Enyo attempt unsuccessfully to pet the rat :(
    - Enyo looks up and see some holes in the wall that look like they lead into a basement
    - Enyo start climbing up the shelves after testing that they seem sturdy
        - I'm shot near my neck with a poison arrow, but I'm a dwarf so pierced: yes, poisoned: no
            - Fuzula doesn't hear the arrow but hears me exclaim and comes in to watch what's happening
        - Fronda calls down to tell me to leave, she doesn't sound intimidating but that seems to be the intent
        - Enyo respond by saying "Look, I'm not a cop, I'm here for some information"
        - Fronda responds she doesn't have any, and Enyo ask if she'd have any info for gold
        - She warily welcomes me up
        - Climbing into the hole despite my nearly fatal wound, Enyo see that the room is a basement
            - Enyo also see that it's other exit is inaccessible
    - We start to talk about the information I'm looking for
        - She insinuates that her loyalty isn't easily bought, but that she was threatened with imprisonment and so her loyalty only extends so far
        - Enyo ask if her loyalty extends past 100, she haggles for 200, and we agree on 150
        - We discuss that Enyo already know she was hired as part of a two crew operation to distract the city guard (she gets nervous)
        - Enyo tell her that Enyo also know that someone is now going around picking off members of those crews (she says she usually does the picking)
        - Enyo tell her that I'm not there to turn her in, I'm there because like money and Enyo think she can connect me with the person who hired her
            - Enyo mention that I'm very money motivated, to make it seem like I'm here to suss out job opps
            - Enyo like money because it's how Enyo get snacks; she also likes snacks and is skilled at stealing them and persuading people to give her snacks
                - Enyo tell her that seems like an awesome skill set to have
    - We get to actually talking about who she's working for
        - She says she was working with, she thinks, Chief Sergeant Pharr; he was disguised the whole time
            - She seems nervous about saying this and looks around, it seems like a genuine reaction
            - Side note, this is the same guy that we already know about, the Chief Investigator/BIL of Ld. Cummings
        - She doesn't think CS Pharr is disciplined enough to be the mastermind and suspects someone hired him, but she doesn't know who
        - CS Pharr did get her in touch with the other members of her crew, but she refuses to give information about them
        - Enyo tell her that's fine, Enyo have a pretty good picture of why they got involved and so Enyo don't think they'll have much more info than she has
        - Speculation is that the harder crew is former or current criminals also threatened with prison
        - At some point, Enyo feel like Enyo should care that she straight up murdered some lady, but Enyo feel like Enyo + the party have bigger concerns at this point
        - Enyo am bleeding out, so Enyo am losing focus, but she seems happy to tell me some other info:
            - The crew was hired to steal 3 things: a small box, and 2 books
            - She says the box will be gone in a couple of weeks
    - One of the books has already been sent off; the other book was reviewed but then returned
    - Enyo didn't ask about the books because we already know that one of the books seems more important than the other
        - She doesn't seem to know where the items are being sent, but she knows where the box and the returned book currently are
    - She seems like she's excited to share the info but knows she shouldn't
        - Enyo tell her that Enyo am very good at keeping secrets
        - She tells me she'll give me 2 gp to share a secret as a joke and Enyo admire her business acumen
            - We do actually trade secrets
    - Enyo start with that we already know that CS Pharr is involved, and that his BIL is also probably involved, but she's unimpressed
    - Enyo hear a voice from on high (a hint from Don) that suggests Enyo should mention that Enyo know Jasper and that piqued her interest
    - In return for the not-so-juicy details at my failure to be a good secret agent for Jasper, she tells me she got to meet Lyriena
        - She met Lyriena while delivering the small box to Lyriena Vault
        - My historical knowledge and Sage background means that Enyo know Lyriena is a famous elven thief that commonly operates in Nuthornville
    - Enyo also know about a slang term, "Lyriena slide," which roughly means to go through an unknown scenario fast to get through it successfully
    - She describes Lyriena as sleek and with her wits about her
    - She was excited because she got to meet Lyriena twice: once delivering the box, once returning the less important
        - As I'm about to leave, Enyo hear a faint cough that sounds suspiciously like the word "where" and remember to ask Fronda where Lyriena's Vault is
        - She says the vault isn't far from where we are in the industrial area of the city; it's over by Hannibal's Jewelry
        - Before Enyo go, Enyo warn Fronda she might be safer out of the city than in it. 
    - Enyo also give her an extra 50 gold with the promise that she'll use it to get the two elderly people set up for a few months and maybe use any extra to help people around the area  
          
    

- Returning to The Lavish Pumpkin
    - Fuzula and Enyo meet up with KereshEnyo in the sewer. In case there are spies around, Enyo loudly tell KereshEnyo that the visit was a waste of time
    - We go back to take a long rest so that Enyo can miraculously heal from my wounds
