## Session Log

The hall we're in has a name - [[Vankilaan Hall]]

> The [[Surma|Surma]] facility near the Baston Door is calledÂ [[Vankilaan Hall]]

Magic Items the party has now that Elinor used to have
- Leather Armor of Acid Resistance
- Potion of Acid Resistance
- 1st level Spell Scroll - Bane
- Mask of Temporal Communication
	- If you wear the mask and the necklace at the same time, you will be put into a stasis
- Wand of Entanglement

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] starts to ask me about [[32 Scalinea/32.00 Compendium/Surma|Surma]], he said:

> [[Ajax]] asked me to apologize, as he never finished telling us about the Putrid Lake. There is a huge snake-like/dragon-esque monster named Jatar-jom Sy who appears like a legless water dragon. We should avoid it as much as we can.
> - [[Nuroempi]]

As [[Nuroempi]] finishes, a large crack and flash happens. "A storm! Aren't you lucky to be inside? Perhaps you'll see [[32 Scalinea/32.00 Compendium/Ajax|Ajax]] again after all." says Nuroempi. He strides towards the hall door, throwing it open midwestern dad during a tornado watch..

Gwynn counselled Kereshi that, while he doesn't know much about [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], of all the gods that I know of, [[Surma|Surma]] feels like the most natural one for you to be involved with."

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]].

I ask [[Nuroempi]] about the interest in the rain, if there was a significance to the interest in it. He responded that it was, for him, about the awesome power displayed by the storm.

[[Nuroempi]] departs, and the party discusses whether to try to trade for the boat or not. We decide to try to get access to the boat. 

Don says: [[Surma|Surma]]'s realm is actually supposed to be cold, and it cools down a lot after the rain.

Gwyn finds some privacy to "pray" to [[Sutamo|Sutamo]]
- I actually get a distinct thought in my head "The reason for the return and who or what caused it isn't important. What's important is that I'm a chosen son, and [[Sutamo|Sutamo]] and the Dark House are happy to have me, and the work that I'm doing is worthwhile."
- Gwyn is calmed by this thought :)

The rain stops as suddenly as it began. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] asks him to let Nuroempi know that we're in the market for a boat. As Enyo starts to make their way to Nuroempi, 7 of the wolves stand up and start making their way towards Enyo - the wolves run past and right out the door. 

Nuroempi
- borrow the boat for the length of time we need it for the Wand of Entanglement
- borrow the boat on the condition that one of Nuroempi's people come with us, for the Flaming Mace and the Temporal Mask

We take a long rest just outside the Hall. I cast Leomund's tiny hut.
- We  take turns at a watch 
	- We see that the tower guards do change out
	- We see zombies walking around several times
	- We see packs of Wights travelling back and forth. Some of which have Glaives.

After the rain, the outside of the plane is green with grass and flowers. By the time we got into the Tiny Hut, the flowers and grass had already wilted.

In the morning we break bread together, for maybe one of the last times.

Enyo would like to dip the stones into the rain water to see if it will fizz.
THere's some discussion about the fizz-ability of the stones
Gwyn gets up to head into the hall. The 2 dead bodies are there again. About 10-15' in from the door are a 6' tall, plate armor, wearing a greatsword on his hip. Phallon is his name. He mistakes me for Kereshi.

I hand Phallon the Mask and the Mace, then go retrieve the party. 

its about 55 outside.

Marching order:
- Gwyn
- Phallon
- Kereshi
- Enyo
- Tsakor

We decide to take a shorter trek to the waterway, heading off at an angle from the hall. The river cuts into the earth, right up to the mountains, without much of an embankment.

Gwyn gets out in front of Phallon, since it's difficult to see around a boat. Gwyn gets direction from Phallon as we walk. We have roughly 5 miles to the river.

About 2 miles into the walk, something jumps out from behind a rock and grabs Gwyn's leg - Roll Initiative!!

It's some kind of zombie-ish thing that grabs my leg - yikes.
Drinking from the basin grants me 1d4 to hit for 11 hours. At this point, I have about an hour-ish.

- kereshi hits twice
- enyo casts toll the dead
- I get hit by the darn thing for 6 points
- Got hit with a critical, but silvery barbs
	- got hit on the second attack
- Gwyn uses Turn Undead, destroying 2 of the creatures, and turning another one.
