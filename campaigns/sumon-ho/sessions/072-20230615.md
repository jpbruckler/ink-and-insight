# 072-20230615

RL Date: [[2023-06-15]]
Last session: [[071-20230601]]

Last episode:
- we [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and I pissed off [[Olgann]]
- tried to make some Orc friends
- we went to the [[Mountain Sanctum]] 
- [ ] Look for emails about dreams and get them in the notebook
- [ ] Paint some minis
- [ ] Work on your own [[33 Sermount|Campaign]]


We leveled up - like actually did the levelling up.

We pass through an S-bend into a main hall, effectively 2 adjoined rooms. The decor is majestic, but not gaudy. 

At the end of the hall, another room 50' deep and 70' wide room with walls that slope up 80', opening to a 20' wide hole to the sky.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] starts talking about his sword to [[Faithe]]. I introduce Enyo to [[Claude]] while [[Faithe]] is busy. I went to the guest room and doff my armor.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] does.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], and [[Claude]] join us.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] to sheathe her sword before continuing. Research suggests 3 ways the stones could be destroyed, though he doubts we could actually do any of them.

1. Bottomless well in the [[Dead Swamp]]. Wouldn't be destroyed, but after falling a few hundred feet, would be out of reach of most. Danger is a Black Dragon
2. Putrid lake. Not of this world, we would need to pass through the upper passage of the [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]]. There is a map in [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]] to help us. Throwing them into the lake would destroy them
3. Take them to the [[Consecrated Forge]] at [[Peidonmaa]]. It would take us months of planar travel to reach it and request the usage of the forge.

Enyo asks how the Consecrated Forge would destroy it. [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] suggests casting Detect Evil and Good. I do, and the stones are evil. I also find out:

- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s sword is neither good nor evil
- 2 of the spirits are celestial
- The bald Elf is a celestial

On the decision:
- No one wanted to go to the pit. The stones would be out of reach of all but the same kinds of people that we're trying to keep these from.
- Fuzula, Gwyn, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] leaning more towards the Putrid Lake.
- Enyo  suggests we try Putrid Lake, and if that doesn't work we could go to Peidonmaa

We decide to stay a couple of days and try to get some guidance from [[Hun-Hoksa]] when she returns.

After evening routine, 3 visitors return to the hall, much to the joy of 

[[Damoira]] is a physics guardian. She brought [[Selena]] in, who has been undercover and living as a street urchin while investigating a cult.

[[Selena]] says she returned at Mother Superior's request and won't be missed. She's made some progress in her investigation, though it's slow. Robert sponsored [[Selena]] into [[The Equilibrium Brotherhood]] (aka the Brotherhood) (the Blessed is the congregation in [[Aimesville]]). 

I ask [[Lana]] for a glass eye. She does not, but suggests that I could ask [[Ipalin]] (male gnome physics investigator) (Don says Ipalin wouldn't have one)

[[Lana]] pulled [[Elinor]] aside as we broke. [[Elinor]] will be separating from the party for a while, to go on a mission for [[Hun-Hoksa]].

Gwyn offers to go on the walks should they go.
Enyo offers to help with the garden and collecting food
Fuzula will help deliver food to the families in the mountains


Notes on Mountain Sanctum operations
- generally if they leave the sanctum at all they're only gone for the day and expected to be home for evening meal
- it's unusual for anyone to be gone (unless on special assignment)
