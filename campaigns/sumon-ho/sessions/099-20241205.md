## Session Overview

### Summary

Olseris got the go ahead from [[The Mace]] to offer his daughter, [[Crystal Mattel]], a position running [[The Spot]] once the party acquires it.

[[Orein]] led us to [[Eldrin|Eldrin's]] grove where after a bit of socializing and trading stories, the Master Druid cast Wind Walk on the party, allowing us a head start in our travels to intercept [[Chief Inspector Farr]] and bring him to face justice in [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]].

- [[Eldrin]] aka "The Master Druid" of the Grove near [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]]

## Stream

- We're back at the [[üó∫Ô∏è Lavish Pumpkin]], it's around 10pm. I chat with [[Crystal Mattel]] a little bit
- We wake up in the morning and grab some breakfast, waiting for [[Orein]] to come get is
    - I did speak with [[The Mace]] about hiring [[Crystal Mattel]], he was agreeable and happy for her.
- I asked Orein about [[üó∫Ô∏è The Great Forest]] and if he knew [[Varis Osteroth]]. Orein mentions he knew of a couple of Varis' that were soldiers, but none that he knew well enough to know their surname.
- We cross the city of Nuthornville to leave through the Forest Gate, our destination is some 10 miles away
- "We are about to enter the realm of [[Eldrin]], the Master Druid. Take care not to insult him." Orein goes on to say that Eldrin will not be in a hurry, and neither should we.
    - Making our way into the Forest, there are a few signs warning away anyone not a friend of Nature
    - As we come to the edge of the encampment, 3 large dogs start growling, showing they know we're there.
    - [[Kereshi]] makes use of her animal handling to demonstrate that we come in peace. Judging by the hounds' response, she got her message across
    - A person comes out of the mudbrick building, he calls the hounds - 2 of them go immediately, the 3rd comes over to get a quick sniff before heading back to lie down near the fire.
- Eldrin waves at Orein, and mentions to Kereshi that it was an interesting interaction
    - He offers some food and the fire, of which we partake
    - I ask about the comment about the being "close to our origins", and the Master explains the theory of evolution
    - We make our group skill check to impress the Master Druid 
    - [[Tragedy]] spent some of his formative years as a Holy Warrior of [[Tapio]] in a glade that Eldrin served in
    - Eventually Eldrin does ask us what we had come to ask. I explain what we're trying to do, and he agreed to cast Wind Walk.
        - He disappears into the hut and comes back with a conical bowl with a couple handful of berries (16 goodberries)
        - And we get our Wind Walk on 
- The spell gets us 240 miles, which is about halfway to our destination, as the crow flies. Chief Inspector Pharr is traveling south, before turning North towards Majesty's tower. 
    - It will take us another 6 days of hiking, which puts us 3 days ahead of the CI.
    - When Wind Walk ends, first order of business is to make camp
- Orein casts a spell, and a 2 story, stone tower appears before us. The first level of the tower is a washroom, bathrooms, and sauna. 2nd floor is a bedroom with 1 bed, furs, and a fireplace.
- I (Olseris) go off to burn some incense, meditate, and work on sword forms.
- Orein has 2 purposes
    - 1 - train Fuzula in scouting
    - 2 - the authority to arrest chief inspector Pharr
- The next morning, we set out, heading west, towards the mountains
- Orein's method of scouting is a change of technique from what we're used to. They're out of sight most of the time.
- While we're walking, I'm asking Kereshi to tell me the story about the time the demon was released. I'm sure that this explanation is completely accurate (note: Kereshi is *definitely* embellishing the facts)
- On the first day there's a wide river we need to cross. Where we've made our way to the river bank, the water is about 18 inches deep. We cross by using a rope tied between us and make our way across, uneventful crossing.
    - there are lots of signs of other creatures that might lead to an encounter, but the skill of our scouts kept us moving without getting into danger.
    - We push ourselves on the first day to cover as much ground as possible
        - hour 9 - everyone makes the skill checks
        - hour 10 - Tsakor and I take 1 level of Exhaustion
        - hour 11 - Orein takes 1 level of exhaustion. Olseris takes another level (2)
        - hour 12 - No other exhaustion
        - We gained a half day of search time - 3.5 days total
    - Orein casts the tower again
        - Note - he can make one of the stories an observatory
    - During the evening I tell the story about Kereshi saving Gwyn
- On the second day we make the group steal check again, granting advantage to our scouts

## Email Highlights
Highlights

* After the night‚Äôs sleep, the party met downstairs for breakfast.
* Olseris spoke to The Mace about Crystal Mattel potentially working as the party‚Äôs steward and inn/tavern manager. The Mace is proud Crystal wants to follow in his footsteps and is supportive of her getting a good opportunity.
* After Orein arrived, the group headed to the grove of Eldrin, Master Druid and Protector of the Natural Way. It was about 10 miles beyond NuThornville‚Äôs Forest Gate.
* Orein warned the party that the Master Druid would not be in a hurry so they shouldn‚Äôt be in one.
* Entering his clearing, 3 hounds rushed toward the party. Kereshi moved slightly forward and used her knowledge of animal behavior to be non-threatening. One of the hounds seemed to befriend her in particular.
* The party was respectful and friendly with Eldrin.
* You patiently talk with the Master Druid around the fire. After half an hour or so, the performance pressure and your impatience give way; and most of you truly enjoy the discussion. You share some of your adventures. While far from charismatic, the druid has a folksy wisdom that is both disarming and welcoming. He shares some history of the area and the deep woods to the south. It is clear that Tragedy spent some of his formative years as a Holy Warrior of Tapio in the same groves Eldrin stewarded. The druid seemed proud to hear the great respect that seeps out of Orein‚Äôs stories of working with Tragedy.¬†
* After 2 hours of conversation, the Master Druid says, ‚ÄúWell. I have enjoyed the company. When you first arrived, Orein said you were here to ask a question of me. Now that we are acquainted, what is this favor?‚Äù
* Eldrin agreed to cast Wind Walk on the party. He gave them 16 berries enhanced with Goodberry spells before casting Wind Walk.
* After speedy flying for 8 hours, the party was a little more than halfway to the Barbed Mountains. Unless weather or other factors slowed them down, the party expected to reach the Barbed Mountains in 6 days march.
* Orein said that although earlier magic indicated ‚ÄúChief Inspector Farr is expected to ‚Äòarrive at his destination in just over a week,‚Äô‚Äù as of this morning he should now arrive in 9 days. This gives the party 3 days leeway to find the keep or make other preparations in advance of his arrival at the keep.
* On the first day of earthbound travel, the party demonstrated they were reasonably weighing speed against safety and predation as they crossed the river and other hazardous environments.
* Orein began training Fuzula to use an expert military methodology for scouting. On the first day, they avoided all chance encounters.¬†
* The party marched on well beyond a typical day of travel. Within the thick forest humidity, three of the party‚Äôs capable adventurers were suffering from exhaustion from the strain. Even after a good night‚Äôs sleep in the magical tower Orein summoned, Olseris was fatigued. However, they had gained half a day.
* The party set out the next morning.
