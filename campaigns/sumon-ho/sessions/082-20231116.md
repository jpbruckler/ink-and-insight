## Session Log

Reminder: The light is coming from the ground in this realm. The light fluctuates as time passes, similar to the rising and setting of the sun

- I set up the tiny hut
- [[Enyo]] setup alarm around the hut
- Fallon setup a tent over the boat, and the tent makes the boat invisible, he ends up sleeping under the tent as well.

while I'm on watch, I see 3 giant crocodiles, 1 of which stopped to investigate Leomond's Tiny Hut by mouthing it. This caused the alarm to wake [[Enyo]] up. Then it was time to wake Kereshi up.

On Kereshi's watch, she sees some type of shadow monster and 3 giant frogs, standing nearly 3' at the shoulder.

More toads appear, and before we can don our armor, the tiny hut is no more.

Kereshi was commanded by a large snake to attack [[Tsakor]]

Overall this battle ran us nearly to the end of our resources.

Session 82 (11/30/2023): Opps, Levitate only goes up

Highlights

*Began travel inÂ the boat with a storm in the distance.

* Kereshi is at the drive-shell again today. She piloted the craft almost without break yesterday. She had been in a gloomy mood since relinquishing Dawnbringer for the Scepter of Eternal Winter. But Captain Kereshi generally has a smile on her face, raising the spirits of everyone despite the foreign world. Seated beside Kereshi, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] rests on the hard seat. [[Enyo]] is on the front seat, while Phallon and [[Tsakor]] sit in the back.

*They saw rapids ahead. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] noted that a large rock that was there minutes ago had sunk below the surface.

*A water monster attacked.

-[[Enyo]] was knocked into the water, but the piranha-like fish were not near the monster.

- [[Gwyn Hovey]] pulled her out quickly.

- [[Phallon]] levitated, which turned out to be a bad strategy as the rest of the party made it to shore.

-A rope was used to pull Phallon toward the group

-The monster left the party alone on the shore

*The party walked past the rapids before getting back into the boat

*As they traveled, they saw a giant with a beautiful bracelet in the mountains.

*The party continued on their way without instigating a rock-flying encounter

*The next group of rapids were very rough, causing all but [[Tsakor]] to fall out

*[[Tsakor]] drove to the shore, while the party swam to the shore

*Continued to travel for another hour, then landed the boat on the mountain side of the river

*Overnight, Kereshi saw goblin-like creatures and hellwasps

*In the morning, they climbed back into the boat to travel

*Soon, more rapids were seen ahead

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 10 am on Month 7/Day 23
