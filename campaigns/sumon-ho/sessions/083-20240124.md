Sarah won't be here on February 15th, so I can use 2 Lepard's GRIP sessions.

- as we break camp I cast Aid
- the water of the river is near the limit of the banks, but has receded slightly after a couple of hours of travel
- there is thick fog cover, obscuring much of the view of inland 
- 10 miles in the distance is the next realm boundary
- sudden movement off to the side of the boat turns out to be giant frogs and some birds
	- the frogs nearly make it to the boat, but became the breakfast of the meat eating fish inhabitants of the river
	- the birds continue overhead
- as we continue to get to the realm boundary, we enter another set of rapids, this time the passage appears to be on the right
	- Kereshi navigates us right through the rapids, with the grace and skill of a much more seasoned captain
- we get to another water monster, this one appears to be stuck on the rocks, whining
	- Phallon would like us to continue
	- the rest of the boat wants to save the suffering Leopleurodon (water monster)
	- we decide to go hunt a frog with the intent of killing and levitating it in front of the monster
		- I rolled a 24 on the survival check
		- found a frog in about 20-30 minutes and summarily wrapped it up and made our way back to the river
		- takes a bit to get back, because of the fog, but we do make it back
	- we decide to go into the river with the frog, Tsakor and Gwynn will misty step behind the monster, and Kereshi and Sarah's character in the boat with the river
	- operation Rescue Charlie the Leopleurodon is a go
		- Tsakor and I misty step
		- Sarah and Kereshi float the frog
		- Tsakor and I successfully push the Leopleurodon
	- I thank Phallon for the cover whilest we were dealing with the Leopleurodon
- We've been on the river for 8 hours (a full day), and the barrier is near. We're ready to stop for the night.
- Kereshi, Gwynn and Tsakor go on the hunt for some fresh food
	- Kereshi rolled a 14 survival
	- We find some tracks that look like Elk.
	- After about an hour of tracking, we realize that not only are we hunting, we're being hunted. 3 giant crocs :O
	- Gwynn nearly dies, but we manage to get enough meat to feed us
	- Kereshi takes the head for a token and spends the evening skinning it
		- overnight she sees 6 more alligators and a mist elemental
- overnight an acidic ooze attacks the hut





Highlights

*The party set out.

*Kereshi expertly navigated the craft through rough rapids.

*The party found a water monster stuck on the rocks when the water receded. It was crying in pain and fear. Despite Phallon’s desire to just let it die, the party was moved to help it.

*Kereshi wasn’t able to use his Javelin of Hadar spell to pull rocks under the monster to free it.

*Kereshi and Gwyn hunted a giant ice frog to tempt it off the rocks.

*Putting their plan in action, Kereshi and Enyo used levitate to dangle the frog in front of the water monster. Meanwhile, Tsakor and Gwyn both misty stepped to the rocks behind it and pushed with all their might. The group’s efforts freed the creature while Phallon provided ‘overwatch.’

*Continuing on, the party left the river for the night a few hundred feet from the barrier of the realm.

*Since they had time, Gwyn, Kereshi, and Tsakor went hunting for fresh meat for dinner. Tsakor donned his breastplate for the hunt.

*They found 3 giant alligators also looking for a meal. The three adventurers had an alligator tail for dinner.

*While Kereshi was skinning an alligator head on watch, he quickly stepped into the hut because a darkness was approaching.

*It turned out to be a large ooze. Kereshi woke Gwyn as it tried to engulf the tiny hut. Gwyn roused Enyo for her fire magic and led her out of the hut while they could. Phallon joined her, as did Tsakor. *Enyo cast a Fireball spell. Amazingly, Phallon did too. Tsakor used eldritch blast. The ooze seeped toward him and smashed Tsakor with a pseudopod. The slam left acid that damaged Tsakor’s breastplate.   

*Kereshi, using the Soul Striker’s soul strike ability, zapped the ooze. Between Kereshi and a final toll from Enyo, it died.

*In the morning, the ooze remains as a thin film membrane where it died. Within its remaining fluid is a chain shirt, a halberd, and a hand axe.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 8:00 am on Month 7/Day 23
