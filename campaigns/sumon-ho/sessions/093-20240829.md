We begin at the Inn...

- Fronda hangs out at the Marred Cask and Tasty Mead tavern.
- The party discusses options
	- discussion around who's doing what

As we finish up, 2 people come in:
- one of them is the one that led the group that came to arrest Kereshi (Roha)
	- studded leather, rapier
	- His name is Tragedy
- the other is a gnome that was there when Kereshi was arrested, also Roha

City Guard
Sienna - the military police
Roha - kind of like CIA/FBI for Aimesland; authority is pretty broad, special purpose organization.

The human addresses us:

Telliva let them know that there were 2 people that needed to be taken into custody. They're here to take Marco and Rhag into protective custody.

>“Find The Gods among Us: Legendary Magi, Advanced Spells and their Exotic Components, read through - any connection between Jasper / Delerium / Advanced Spells & their components?” He responded “Hey Gwyn, I’ll check it out.”

sis owes 17g for entry

magic condensation is delirium 

The famous magic users book says:
abigail's spell had a spell called "Reset Spell" that would disrupt anti-magic fields. This spell uses magic condensation as a component.

The spell component book indicates that the delerium is magic condensate.

This costs me 2 sending spells, Booster cuts out in the middle of the first.

I tell Telliva, he lets Tragedy know. There are 3 places in Nuthornville that uses this defense

1. Super max jail - where they keep powerful magic users
2. The bank

Olseris uses mask of many faces to look like Marco and heads to the Lively Wench.

The rest of the party heads to the Marred Cask and Tasty Mead Tavern in the Industrial Ward, near the East Ward gateway (the gateway allows traffic between the East Ward and Industrial Ward).

As we pass Eberheim warehousing we turn left. Within a couple of blocks the buildings are in disrepair - Swivel Lane.

Telliva says "This is swivel lane, we call it that because you have to keep your head on a swivel".

We arrive at the Marred Cask. A drunken half-elf woman is outside.

Fuzula hides behind a barrel (I roll a 1) - she's convinced she's well hidden.

Gwyn asks Telliva to stay outside.

Insight check: is the drunk lady really drunk? Pretty sure she's not as drunk as she thinks. She tells Kereshi "Buzz off, fly."

We push through the doors - kereshi, me, then enyo

The bartenders have rashes on their hands. Standing at the bar is an old decrepit man taking a drink with a staff.

A human and dwarf elbow wrestle.

A man in the corner scowls as we enter the bar, behind him is a woman in heavy makeup, her hair has a 6 inch blonde streak - clearly Fronda.

Kereshi starts staring. I lead us to a table.

I try to talk back to the bartender, it doesn't work.

We're friends with "the lady that killed their friends" - meaning the guy that Fuzula killed when we were rescuing the preisty guy.

Kereshi goes up to get some drinks and learns that information. Then she mouths off to the bartender and they have the whole "meet me outside" thing. Kereshi went outside and the drunk half elf came in behind him, locking the door behind her, and Kereshi outside.

Kereshi uses her echo to get back in.

Gwyn makes a small speech about how we're more than meets the eye.

The old man at the bar says "While I disagree with the delivery, I agree with the sentiment." Then casts some spell at Kereshi that halves the damage of each melee attack.

Kereshi grabs the other bartender and calls him a punk ass bitch. The bartender replies "Yep, just like he described you."

Telliva knocks at the door, identifies himself as a Roha, and is let in.

When things de-escalate, Fronda starts to open the door at the back of the bar, but there is someone in the doorway. A spear-wielding man comes in, with a shield strapped to his arm. He takes a seat, and leans his spear against the table. The door leads to a back room.

Through the door we can see a woman and 2 young boys in the back room.


I ask if we can actually get  our ale, without the cough in it :). The wizard gets the ale, and says it'll still be 7GP. 

We find out the guy we tied up and interrogated lived.

---

I offer to heal the disease, or try to. The wizard dude said "No, disease is part of life. The reason they're so dangerous is because people avoid them."

Which is an indication of them being anti-vaxxers.

This is somewhat related to why Istari was kidnapped.

---

Olseris is able to pull off the Marco ruse, but nothing really came of the visit. No one was even surprised to see Marco there. Indicating that no one was really in on it.

Meeting up at the Lavish Pumpkin, Fuzula said she followed Fronda to where she was staying - not so much a house, but a "location"
