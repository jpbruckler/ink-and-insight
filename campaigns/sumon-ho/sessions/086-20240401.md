Sutamo's followers
- CE, CN, N
- some assassin's 

Misquiet
- has an undead sounding voice, but when he took his helmet off, he had blond hair, attractive
- lore: he doesn't defer to Surma enough, and has been admonished for that several times

- Misquiet's horse is very Night Mare-ish, with the flames and the flying.
- Misquiet never entered the church


- In the evening, the party is outside the [[Vankilaan Hall]] when [[Misquiet.md]] comes back and summons me and Tsakor
	- Misquiet is wearing an Exquisite longsword on his waist, and a dark grey silken cape, like down to his waist
- He bamf's us to Sutamo. Hot sulphuric air surrounds us. Eventually we feel the ground beneath our feet. (This is Tartarus)
- cobblestone road leads off to a keep, a mile away. The other way is a town, 2 miles away
- every so often 4x4 earthen columns with a light on top.
	- near the castle the columns are closer together, looking down the road it's clear that the columns are farther apart.
- a couple of times during the walk with Misquiet, he offers some conversation about more martial subjects
- Misquiet asks why we don't like him
	- there's some awkwardness in this conversation, lol
	- there was some almost hard selling to follow his teachings
	- I asked for a copy of his teachings
- As we enter the compound, there are guards, but they seem to not pay us any mind.
- As we walk through the castle compound, there's not really a lot of people around, mostly just guards. Though there are a few people.
	- across the way from where we're heading there's a stable boy leading some horse's into a building
- the castle is like a motte and bailey
- we passed through the outer wall, and on the way to the inner wall, I ask Misquiet if he's able to get over the wall, like jumping or levitating. He says that's what his horse is for 
- We're stopped by guards as we approach the inner wall
	- Misquiet was a bit disrespectful of the guard. 
	- The guard says "Be careful, I decide whether you pass or not"
	- Misquiet disagrees, saying "No, it's your Lord that decides. You just decide whether you survive the encounter."
	- It's pretty tense. 
	- The Captain of the guard pokes his head out and says to the guard "Grant him permission so he can do his business and leave."
	- Misquiet says to the captain "I appreciate you. You're going places, but you should definitely work on this guy."
- We start walking again. Misquiet leads us along without asking direction
- Within the castle, the halls are are kept dark, some of the rooms are lit. There are alcoves along the walls, but it's difficult to tell if the figures there are actual guards, or just statues.
- We eventually get to a large, rectangular audience hall, about 100' long. There is a daias with a pair of high-backed chairs upon it.
	- There's a man with 2 short swords. One is more traditional, and worn on his back. The one on his side is a bit abnormal, as it gets wider at the tip.
	- The dude is muscular and moves like a cat, athletic.
	- I and Gwyn both assume that this is Sutamo.
	- Gwyn see him like a caged animal
- While we make our way to him, he does close the distance a bit.
- Misquiet introduces us
	- I take a knee and thank him for the audience.
- Misquiet also sees fit to demean Sutamo in his own castle. It get's a little tense again.
- Sutamo takes us to a separate room. (20x20)
	- As we walk in there's a sound difference. In the audience room there was the normal sound. As we cross the threshold into the room, there's a magical boundary that blocks the noise from the rest of the keep..
	- Sutamo leans up against the table and asks "What's this pressing matter?"
	- I explain there was no pressing matter, Misquiet just said he could introduce us
	- I asked about being brought back
		- Sutamo said his permission was asked, but that it wasn't him that brought me back. It was another deity.
		- There is a great evil (the Eternal One) in our world, and that it needs to be stopped
			- This confirmation is important. There is some general agreement that there is an "Eternal One", but he's kind of just thought of as a "boogey man". It's unclear in our world whether he's real.
		- It was asked if I (Gwyn) could be held in state until this evil resurfaced
		- Diancecht believe that I would be a key to defeating the evil in some way.
		- The interest in me was due to the Night house teaching resourcefullness and I was seen as the most persistent and resourceful of his priests at the time.
	- I asked what we can do to further his work
		- He told Tsakor to come back through the portal to the Dark House. Father Anthis prays to Sutamo often about his concerns leading the rogueish part of the church.
		- As for me, one avenue that I may help would be to gather alliances to face the Eternal One. He mentions that the Sage of Life and Death has been concerned about the Eternal One's return.
			- the Northern Army was supposed to be a reminder of the Eternal One to the world, but it was defeated, and the reminder was lost.
			- Sage of Life and Death - SLD. _THE_ Sage of Life and Death has a tower in the Ravaged Lands. He's not fond of visitors :)
			- Will need to reach out to someone in the SLD to arrange a meet.
		- We talk for another 15-20 minutes. Sutamo is being very Brian Rich.
	- The order of deities - see the Deities and Demigods book
		- higher-deity
		- lower-deity
		- quasi-deity
		- advancing starts with bieng a minor hero (4 levels), then a major hero (6 levels) (Jasper, Misquiet), at the point of being a major hero, you start attracting followers. Get enough followers, you can become a quasi-deity.
		- Sutamo is a quasi-deity
	- Sutamo presents Tsakor and I with holy symbols - Don says they're not magic items, but then back tracked and said they might be - he'll email me. Either way they're special and something that Gwyn will treasure
-  When we get back out to Misquiet, he's doing sword forms. There's a brief, very Misquiet-esque exchange, but Misquiet gets permission 
- During the conversation with Sutamo, it came out that Kali doesn't have an interest in bridging the Abyss, and so wouldn't offer up the stone - so, the cult is really not likely a concern.
