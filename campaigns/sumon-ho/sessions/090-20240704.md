Murdered lady was a research assistant at "[[Fiery Blend]]"

Was Ella researching anything in particular?
- Andrew says not really, but he didn't think the murder and the burglary were related. She was aware of the back room, and also was there when the delerium came in.
- She wouldn't have been able to to tell anyone how to bypass any of the magical protections, but she would be able to tell them *where* the protections were

Highlights

*The party headed over to the 4th crime location, a middle-aged couples’ fourth floor apartment vandalized, primarily with paint and oil.

-The couple returned from dinner to find their apartment vandalized.

-The party is now confident that there are two crews identifiable by whether the mark left has a ‘full eye’ or lacks the bottom line. Because there seems to be a crew of 4 and a crew of 3, it isn’t believed to be simply that the mark is made by different crew members.

-The female resident makes excellent raisin bread, although she has to make it at her job because they don’t have a stove or fireplace.

-The only thing stolen was some bread, although they didn't have much to take.

-Gwyn gave them 15 gp ‘for their assistance,’ but more so out of generosity and to help community members.

-A day or two ago, the lady downstairs told them that she had come up to their room on the day of the crime because she heard a commotion.

-Enyo went down to talk to the elderly resident below the vandalized apartment.

-She recounted that as she came up the south stairs, she saw four individuals who had just reached the other stairs. From the back, she couldn’t see much because all 4 wore pants, long sleeves, and 2 wore hoods. From the back of the head, the other two looked like a human (brown hair) and a half-elf or maybe heavy elf (soft blue hair). No one answered the door to the apartment, so she returned home.

-Enyo gave her a gp, maybe she would have given more if the woman didn’t seem so rude toward dwarves.

*The party headed to the next crime site, the lab and office of renowned alchemist Andrew Ilstim. Over a hundred gp worth of components were stolen, as well as some vandalism.

-Before arriving, the group had asked Telliva if he knew the address of the Fiery Blend where the murdered Ella was a research assistant. He said he did, and that they were headed there now since it was the same place.

-The alchemist’s office is on the 2nd floor, above the storefront for a well-respected armorer. Master Artisan Ilstim has an advanced lab on the building’s 3rd floor too.

-The receptionist, when learning why they are here, goes back into the lab to see if Master Artisan Ilstim will see them. She is rudely accurate, correcting an unimportant detail in a party member’s statement.

-He isn’t receiving visitors, but he will see the party.

-Kereshi goes to check the back door while Tsakor monitors the reception area and front of the building.

-After the party approaches and he finishes monitoring his experiment, he shares with the party that over 100 gp of components were stolen and some were damaged. He seemed confident the intruders did not go to the third floor advanced lab.

-Some of the damaged components reacted with each other, probably inadvertently.

-When asked, he said that the stolen chemicals were generic and could be used for a wide range of compounds, from a Potion of Healing to Slippery Grease. He said nothing rare was taken, although Gwyn sensed there was more to the story.

-Additionally, he was nervous when Enyo asked if she could cast Detect Magic even though she gave a good reason. He could have just been nervous about some of his magical protections being revealed (after all, he doesn’t know the party) or he could be trying to hide something.

-There were several magical protections including a couple of alarm spells. Enyo also could tell there was a door hidden behind a bookshelf (outlined with an alarm spell and having other magic on it).

-The alchemist did eventually reveal that there was more stolen than he told the guard. He asked that it not be included in any official report. He wasn’t concerned with the Rauha. Their integrity was not questioned and he wasn’t breaking any specific laws. He was concerned about either an untrustworthy guard member or unwanted attention from the guard in his business/research. The latter is more likely, but the former was an unacceptable risk.

-Andrew Ilstim had a valuable and largely untested magical component he called delerium.

-He purchased his delerium from a group of five adventurers who acquired it somewhere in the mountains between the Conquered Lands and the Dead Swamp (probably somewhere south of Strolbreln).

-He kept it in his secret safety room (the size of a walk-in closet) with other prized materials. It was stolen, along with a Ring of X-ray Vision.

-Ella was present when he purchased it from the adventurers but the little bit of testing he had done was him alone.

-Delerium, as Iltrim knows it, is a dark material with a light sheen across it. He had 2 “sticks” of it similar in size to a stick of chalk. He stored it in a small box. When he opened it, a slight mist would escape as if they gave off a vapor. He never touched it with bare hands but noted when he last saw it one was slightly larger than the other as if it had grown ever so slightly in the 3 months he had it.

-Andrew Iltrim was disappointed when he learned that a stolen book from the library on advanced material components may have had information in it that would have jumpstarted his research.

*At around 6 pm, the party headed back to the Lavish Pumpkin to strategize.

-In the morning a few hours after sunrise (i.e. 10 am) the party is to meet Aribis Psicon to exchange magic items and gold.

-Gwyn, Tsakor, and Telliva will quickly go through the remaining crime sites to see if any have the vandal symbol that suggests the more important crime crew.

-Enyo, Fuzula, and Kereshi will go talk to another well-known alchemist to see if they have any information connecting Jasper, delerium, and advanced spells (and their components).

* Telliva is going to meet with them at the financial institution at 10 am. He left.

*Gwyn asked Divination (4th level spell) to know ‘if the group causing all the mayhem here is going to interfere, disrupt, or otherwise act at the Gathering tomorrow night.’ The answer was “No, the group won’t interfere, disrupt, or act against the Gathering.”

*Fuzula asked Gwyn to contact Booster to help research. He cast two Sending spells.

-To Booster: “Find The Gods among Us: Legendary Magi, Advanced Spells and their Exotic Components, read through - any connection between Jasper / Delerium / Advanced Spells & their components?” He responded “Hey Gwyn, I’ll check it out.”

-To Averos: “Found books, The Gods among Us: Legendary Magi, Advanced Spells and their Exotic Components. Need info on these and delerium. Willing to trade work.” Averos responded: “We should talk.” With Averos’s own Sending, he asked “Where are you?” Gwyn responded, “In NuThornville investigating a crime spree. Staying at the Lavish Pumpkin.”

*The stolen books from the library were “The Gods among Us: Legendary Magi” and “Advanced Spells and their Exotic Components.”

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 7:30 pm on Month 7/Day 28
