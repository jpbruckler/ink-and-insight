## Session Log


What are we doing?
- Collecting the [[Stones of Power]]s
- Racing against the cult that's trying to collect these all
- The intent is to try to destroy the Crimson [[Stones of Power|Power Stone]]

Options

- Ignore the 3rd stone, go to [[Hun-Hoksa]] to see what they've found out.

Questions
- Where is the last stone?
- How can they be destroyed?
- Gwyn wants to know 
    - more about this cult and the knights
    - how to destroy the [[Stones of Power|penetration stones]]
- Where is Grinvah?

We finally decided to leave the Underdark and head to [[Hun-Hoksa]]. 

Sending to [[Lana]]
- [[Lana]] this is Gwyn. We have another stone. Can we bring it to you? Want to hear what you've found about destroying them.

On the 2nd to last day out of the Underdark, it's been interesting, with the sight of fungus giving way to rodents and bugs. Butterlies crossed with lightning bugs. 

Gwyn asks Dranaste if this is unusual. Dranaste mentions it's not necessarily unusual. Elinor tries to catch a butterfly (flutterlitflies). They smell like sliced strawberries. The flutterlitflies make room for us as we move.

About 100' beyond that, Dranaste stops in his tracks. 30' in front of him the tunnel opens up into a large space, another 60' beyond that Dranaste and Gwyn see a wall.

We walk up to the edge.

Edge of a cavern, the bottom and top are jagged and tapered. Tear is 120' tall and 300' long. Bodies are at the bottom. Near the center it's nearly 60' across. THe tunnel we're standing in is about 2/3rd from the bottom of the bottom. Across from us is what we imaging to be the rest of the tunnel about 50' across and 10' over from us.

We see about 100' away from us, there are several (10-ish) bird-like creatures.

Gwyn flies, using his cloak of the bat, to fly down to the bottom of the cavern. About 10-15' down, the large birds have started sniffing the air. One sees me and squawks, then starts heading towards us.

Kereshi thinks she sees a couple birds roosting on the wall near the others that are flying.

About halfway down, I see about 5 more heading my way, I head back to the party. I was close enough to see that the bodies at the bottom were humanoid, covered with abrasions, and the bodies have been picked at.

When Gwyn gets 10' away from the tunnel - we ROLL INITIATIVE

Kereshi jumps onto the back of one of the birds, attacking another one within reach. After downing his first target, he turns his axe against the one he's riding, damaging it, but not killing it.

Enyo takes out 4 with a well placed Lightning Bolt.

The bird that Kereshi is riding freaks out and moves away from the group, carrying Kereshi away.

A 3rd swarm of birds replaces the ones we downed. The fight isn't hard, but it is using our resources.

Another bolt of lightning from our newest member takes out another 3.

"That bird will have to plummet to the ground before it gets me off!" - Michael

The bird he was riding flew off to the other side of the cavern. 

Elinor and Gwyn use Fly and Steps of Night to ferry people across the cavern.

Kereshi uses his ring of jumping to jump from the bird, in mid air, slamming into the cavern wall, slides 10-15' down the wall before she gets a grip.

In a rare moment of genius, Kereshi threw her new Lizard totem into a hole in the wall, magically it turns into a Giant Lizard, under Kereshi's control.

We all make it to the other side of the cavern, no worse for wear.
