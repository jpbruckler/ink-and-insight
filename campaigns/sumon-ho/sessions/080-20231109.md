## Session Log

- river water is fast-moving, and while the rest of the land is barren, the banks of the river have some vegetation
- we (Tsakor) spy some red wolves
- Fallon has black eyes, copper hair, and smooth skin
- Kereshi and Gwyn realize no one brought the oars - it only took an hour to get here, but it would be annoying to go back
	- Enyo suggests using the backpacks to get oars from the mountain sanctuary
	- Fallon cuts in to let us know that the boat has it's own propulsion
	- The ones in the middle have to steer O_o
	- The ammonia odor that's been stinging our eyes abates when we get onto the water
- Enyo checks out the water, which is dark, and hard to see the bottom, but they figure it's roughly 20' deep

- Fallon explains how to operate the boat to Kereshi
	- There is a shell in the middle of the boat, moving the shell in any direction (left, right, forward, back) impacts the direction of the vessel to a degree

- Even at 20' deep, there's still plenty of rocks breaking the surface
- Fallon suggests that there are some rapids ahead, and if anyone has vehicle experience, it would be best for them to control the boat (no one does)
	- He also mentions that leaving a realm is difficult - we will physically and mentally want to avoid it.
- We pass 6 wights, one of them decides to attack - Fallon reaches out his hand and just speaks a single word: "No."
- The wights stop, except for one who tries to defy Fallon - the rest of the wights immediately pull the wight down and pummel him.
- Since we have some time to kill, Gwyn asks about what our plan is, specifically.
	- While there was plenty of talk, not much of a real plan came to fruition.
	- The nagging pessimism and weigh of this situation continues to weigh on Gwyn, and this discussion did nothing to abate it.
- Roughly 2 miles out, a fear starts to creep into all of us. Within a mile of the realm of the boundary, the fear turns to dread. The intensity of the feeling continues to grow as we get closer to the mist that marks the boundary.
- I cast Bless on the boat everyone except Fallon.
	- Everyone but Kereshi and Tsakor makes their skill check.
	- Kereshi suddenly slams the boat hard away from the barrier
	- Gwyn is thrown nearly out of the boat, if not for Fallon
	- The boat hits the shore on the other side of the river.
		- Tsakor disembarks and tries to steel himself against the fear
		- Kereshi also disembarked and also steels herself against the fear
	- We all decide to walk through the barrier
	- As we pass through, the extreme mental toll causes all of us some psychic damage. "It's so scary that it hurts; literally." - Don
- On the other side, the landscape is completely different. Surma's realm is like a moonscape. This realm is swampy, wet, damp, and generally uncomfortable. Visibility is terrible due to dense vegetation
- We re-embark; this time I sit next to Kereshi in the middle of the boat.
- 60' above the river in the sky are creatures flying, a flaming steed with a 7' rider with a flaming skull
- One of the neat tricks of this plane - 
	- there is a light in the sky, we initially thought of it like a moon. With the rider interaction, we realize that the thing we thought was the moon is actually glowing just like the "orb" that we're on.
- Enyo asks Fallon about the flying dude
	- The rider is a "Fire Boy"
	- The horse is a Night Mare
	- They're both fiends
- We're heading into some rapids - I cast guidance on Kereshi
	- Gwyn can tell that the carnivorous fish aren't in the rapids area, they must not like the rough water
	- Kereshi pilots the boat through the rough waters and protruding rocks
	- We've been travelling around 6 hours and should start looking for a place to camp in the next couple hours
- Tsakor sees something out in the sky, 3 things heading for us
	- Fallon tells us to get him to the bank "They won't respect the river and I don't want to fight on the water."
	- The humanoid with wings addresses Fallon, they argue with each other.
	- Roll initiative!
	- Fallon holds his hand up to the Eagle and says, in a commanding voice "You are in darkness!" and there was a look of fear on the Eagle's face
	- Kereshi uses Javelin of Hadar to try to pull down the floating orb - and the orb fails his saving throw
	- We find 80gp on the Aasimar
		- 13gp each
