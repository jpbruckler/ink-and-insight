## Session Overview

### Summary

[[Danger Inc.]] escorted [[Calcryx]] back to the [[Kobold Body]], where the [White Dragon Wyrmling](https://ddb.ac/monsters/white-dragon-wyrmling) immediately went on the offensive. [[Danger Inc.]] helped the kobolds re-capture the dragon and were rewarded with a key for their troubles. [[Yusdrayl|Queen Yusdrayl]], convinced that the party would at least share the common goal of ridding the ruins of goblins, was content to provide them passage throughout her domain.

### Important NPCs

- 

### Key Events

- We double-crossed [[Calcryx]], turning on him when we returned to the [[Kobold Body]]

### Reflections

- We double crossed the dragon, and are definitely talking about potentially doing the same to the Kobolds - are we the baddies?

### Follow-up Actions

- 

## Stream


Quest: [[Search and Rescue - Powell]]

- [[Yusdrayl]], in draconic, welcomed [[Calcryx]], the [[white dragon wyrmling]], home.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]. He told [[Yusdrayl]] that he is “no one’s pet.”
- During the battle, [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] critically hard.
- One raider was killed by a [kobold](https://ddb.ac/monsters/kobold). The one with the magical shortbow was killed by [[Bronson]] as it tried to escape.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] was able land a few blows against the dragon, but didn’t have enough power left to stop [[Calcryx]].
- Thanks to [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]]’s longbow, [[Calcryx]] was brought down, the final blow being an arrow through the neck.
- [[Eljas]] used Spare the Dying to save the dragon pet. 
- [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]] turned the key over to him for the group’s service to the "[[Kobold Body]]" She also asked if they would continue to assist the "[[Kobold Body]]" by eliminating the goblins from the rest of the fortress, since it was clear they shared a dislike for them. She could not allow them to continue to get so bold. The party agreed. (About 2 dozen of them)
- The party took a long rest, discussing treasure distribution and which way to go next. The party would work to destroy the [goblin](https://ddb.ac/monsters/goblin) warriors before tackling the magical areas (closet or lock). [[Bronson]] would carry the magic shortbow as no one else really needed one.
- The party stopped by [[Yusdrayl]] and awoke her to make sure they understood the deal. She told them there were about 2 dozen [goblin](https://ddb.ac/monsters/goblin) warriors, not counting women and children.
- They traveled to the hazy room with dragon-carved columns.
- Taking the ‘dinosaur hallway’ around they found the [Goblin](https://ddb.ac/monsters/Goblin) lair housing families. They backed out without raising an alarm.
- They continued on to the door of a cylindrical wall.
