40 minutes has passed since the invisibility cast

We walk through the Double Doors...

- smells of incense and paper, several bookshelves filled with antique books

I notice a desk that catches my eye - The Gods Among Us

I take it :O




- Kereshi listens at the single door - 
	- Someone saying "I'm gettin to you" x 3, and the sound of many animals
	- She decides to get them on the way back
- Fuzula listens at the double door - hearing nothing at the door, she moves through
	- a 10' wide spiked pit spans the room, with a bridge connecting the 2 sides of the room
	- flickering lamp on the south and north walls.
	- there is a spiral staircase on the north end of the room, heading up
	- As I approach the bridge *something happens*
		- Something slams Kereshi in the back and she falls into the pit, covered in blood, she's no longer invisible.
			- 6 damage for the fall (10')
			- 9 piercing damage from the spikes
			- 24 points of poison damage
		- I'm also accosted by an unseen attacker, but the hit didn't land
		- Enyo casts see invisibility, and is able to see that the attacker is made up of air, similar to an air elemental.
	- After battle, Kereshi explains that she saw the bridge on the other side of the pit, while she was in it. After some questioning, we understand that it's an illusion so we're able to get across the bridge safely
	- We ascend the spiral staircase.
	- We end up on the 2nd floor
	- Fuzula picks a lock
		- This looks like a pretty fancy bedroom, with it's own privy
	- Kereshi opens the door
	- I cast silence, centered on the door as they walk through
	- There's people on the balcony, so I drop silence.
	- I use Mask of Many Faces to look like the guard that passed close in front of me on the first floor
	- I go into the bedroom alone, closing the door behind me
		- I go behind the curtain and take a quick look around (19 perception)
			- there's a couple of nice paintings in here, most of the room is well kitted out
			- I get the impression that someone looking in from the balcony would have a hard time seeing me
			- There's a romance novel on the nightstand
			- There's some lantern oil and a dagger in the drawer, but really nothing of interest
		- The desk is locked, and some sheets of paper with drawings on them. Like hand drawn floor plans, unable to tell what they are, so I leave the room


Email Recap
*The party stepped through the swiveling secret door from the gallery into the library.

*The group crossed across the room toward the double doors on the other side.

*While crossing the room, Olseris saw on the desk a book title that caught his attention. The copy of _The Gods Among Us: Legendary Magi_ was on the desk.

*As Fuzula listened at the double doors, Kereshi listened at the single door.

*Beyond the single door, it sounded like two guards were feeding the animals contained within.

*Unbeknownst to the party, walking on the large carpet in the middle of the room summoned an Elemental Tracker.

*Not hearing anything at the double doors, Fuzula opened the door and the party filed in.

*They were in a large room split down the center by a spiked pit. A bridge spanned its 10’ width. 

*As Gwyn approached the bridge and Kereshi the pit, the invisible Tracker attacked: It pushed Kereshi into the pit where she hit a few poisoned spikes.

*While in the pit, Kereshi learned that a spell hid a real bridge making it look from those above as if it was the pit.

*The Tracker couldn’t survive 2 lightning bolts to the chest (one from Kereshi’s javelin and the other an Enyo spell), not to mention Fuzula arrows.

*A little testing proved that the actual bridge was hidden by an illusion while the visible bridge was illusionary.

*Heading up the metal stairs, the party reached the second floor. Over the sound of animals, the guards didn’t appear to have heard the combat through the walls.

*The group walked single file along the outside wall of the second floor; south in the interior of the west wall, then east along the south wall toward a beautiful red cedar door.

*Fuzula picked the lock to the door as Olseris cast Silence centered on the door.

*Kereshi looked in to see a large desk workspace and a sleeping area. This is clearly a bedroom for Lyriena for when she stays at the vault overnight (or naps there).

*While the rest of the party continued down the hall, Olseris invoked his magic to disguise himself as the guard he saw earlier downstairs.

*Olseris stepped in the door, walked through the dividing curtain, and looked around the sleeping area. He found a lantern, romance novel, wardrobe with Lyriena’s clothes, and plush bean bag chair. Slipping back through the curtain, Olseris took a close look at the desk. It was locked. While he found some hand-drawn pictures of blueprints, nothing of particular value was found.

*Olseris headed out the door back into the hall to catch up with the others.

Note: At the end of the session, it was 2:20 from Olseris’s perspective and 2:00 from the other party members’ perspective.   

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 2:00/2:20 am on Month 8/Day 2
