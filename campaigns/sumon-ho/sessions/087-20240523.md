Turns out Fallon is the Jailor that we ran into on the way to [[Vankilaan Hall]]

We decided to take another rest, staying outside of the Hall before striking out in the morning

Thanks to being on the plane of chaos, the Wind Walk spell was impacted and we found ourselves as water instead of mist, but the rest of the functions of the spell work as normal.

As we fly over the crevice, we can see a Devilish looking creature standing what we estimate to be 25-30' tall chained up in the bottom of the crevice.

As we fly over the big hill, in graves, there are several creatures that look like human heads with wings (gross).

We also bypass a group of zombies

45-minutes later, we arrive at the monolith marking the gate. Standing 7' tall, 7' wide, and 7' deep. As we get within 200' of the monolith, we see a small birdlike creature some 2 to 3 times higher than us. It's havng a hard time flying against the wind.

> kinda weird to see wildlife, as we haven't seen much in the way of any while we've been here, though there is some.

At the base of the monolith we notice a  thick liquid, like molasses, with metal glinting in it.

We land within 60' of the monolith. Kereshi, myself, and Fuzula un-mistify. The pool of liquid on the ground starts to solidify into a spiky, humanoid like creature on the 6th turn of 10.

On the 7th turn of 10 it has fully formed.

Tsakor dashes forward in mist form, and the creature at the monolith rushes towards Tsakor.

8th turn.

Highlights

*Misquiet returned Gwyn and Tsakor to the learning square of Vankilaan, he soon departed on his flying stallion.

*The party convened. While a few were anxious to get back to exit the Putrid Plane, some (including Kereshi) felt they should wait until “morning” when they could use Gwyn’s necklace’s Wind Traveler spell. Waiting until after a sleep was the chosen course.

*After breaking camp in the morning, Ajax bid them goodbye as they began their trip.

*With the chaotic influence of the Putrid Plane, the Wind Traveler spell turned the group into water figures instead of mist. However, they were still able to fly and to do so with amazing speed.                                                                                                                                                             

*Flying about 30’ off the ground, they saw the captive chained in the crevice under guard of a Wight Master and its wights.

*They saw several undead, including skeletons, zombies, a pack of wights, and also vargouille hidden within a grave.     

*After less than an hour of high-speed flight, they neared the portal.

-In the distance against the curtain of fog that identifies the boundary to this realm, the party saw the 4-sided, taper-edged monolith roughly 7’ tall and similar in width and depth. You are anxious to cross the half mile to reach it; anxious for your home plane; anxious to take a breath without the ammonia in the air that has made all of your throats feel raw over these last few days. The monolith’s grey stone is visible in the red light of the ground.

- As you approach within 200 feet of the structure, you can see a small birdlike creature flying high in the sky. It is a deep green color, or rather, looks deep green in this red light. It has been struggling against the wind. As you glance at it, it flitters farther away. The wind is beginning to die down. You also notice at the base of the obelisk a glint of metal. It looks like a liquid like molasses or pitch has accumulated near the structure. The liquid has some kind of metal in it.  

*There didn’t seem to be a way to speak to or corner the birdlike creature before returning to solid form, so the thought was abandoned.

*Gwyn, Kereshi, and Fuzula landed 60’ from the obelisk and began the process to solidify.

*The three were barely half way through the immobilizing transformation when the tar near the structure quickly formed into a vicious fiend. Partially through the process, they were powerless to resist.

*Enyo landed and began her own transformation. Meanwhile, Tsakor, although unable to do anything but distract it, flew nearby to draw it away from the helpless friends.

*Tsakor kept moving, but was soon very badly injured trying to stay close enough to keep its attention but limit the number of attacks he had to withstand. A second monster had appeared and joined the fray.

*The tarry arrived at Gwyn and Kereshi as they were regaining control of their material form.

*Kereshi’s great axe slipped from her grip as it stuck to the tarry’s adhesive hide. Other objects were also attached.

*A terrible battle ensued. Kereshi put Soul Striker to effective use with exceptional skill combined with some fortunate hits. She left it all on the field, using every ability and still falling to the second fiend if not for Gwyn’s healing magic. Her death blow on the first fiend was nothing short of amazing. [The second of three “zaps” from Soul Striker]

*Seeing the tides having turned despite Kereshi fighting to retain consciousness, the second tarry turned invisible and bolted. Only its magic resistance had prevented Gwyn’s faerie fire from undermining its invisibility. So it dropped Kereshi, turned invisible, and tried to dart away. Kereshi pounded on it with her bare fists, but it was Gwyn’s deft use of the Halbert of the icelands that was the final strike to bring the creature down. It was Gwyn’s third hit in a row.

*Gwyn provided some much needed healing.

*The party found many items stuck to the carcasses.

-11 gems appraised at 1,000 gp each, 3 of which were diamonds

-3 magic items, including a Defender Shortsword, Longsword +1, and a wand of polymorph

-Non-magical items, including a greatsword, pike, and shield

*It was a close call, but an exhilarating fight and an amazing display of luck mixed with talent. The party collected themselves approximately 50’ from the portal they used to arrive at the Putrid Plane.

*In the aftermath of the pitched battle, Kereshi handed the Scepter of Eternal Winter over to Gwyn. This has 3 advantages, including it is attuned to a caster who may be in a better position [action economy wise] to utilize the spells, the most situationally aware (perception/insight) person in the party doesn’t need to sleep even though his senses will want some downtime, and the loss of a single party member doesn’t mean the loss of both these legendary items (the Eternal Artifacts).  

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 10 am on Month 7/Day 26
