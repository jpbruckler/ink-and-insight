## Session Log

Grinvah has been travelling for years.

Small braziers set ahead of us, burning with green flame.

A giant lizard is on ... (see previous description of the [[Dreedasesh estate]])

A female drow with whips and chains, she's being lead by an 11' foot tall bipedal 

We head to the gazebo, before we get there I give the spider to Enyo.

Lady Vicania Dreedasesh addresses the group, except for Gwyn. Vicania lets us know that the Lady of the House is out and won't be back for several hours. She asks if we'll stay for a while.

Vicania was tapping the railing while waiting or a response. Gwyn's insight check doesn't reveal anything specific, other than it's clear the tiredness that surrounds her didn't fall on her shoulders in the last 12 hours. Though [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] seems nervous :)

Note: Michael was very nervous about this whole arrangement.

The giant spider starts crawling up the wall.

We all head towards the garden. 

[[Viconia Dreedasesh]] 

[[Solral Dreedasesh]] - acts

DM insight - Vicania is warming up to [[Elinor]].

[[Elinor]] asks Vicania to give a tour, which she does. She waves off the guards that start to follow her.

Seeing that Vicania is joining the group, Gwyn goes to find a place with some of the fighting folk.

Vicania gives a short tour, then asks Enyo to finish the tour. After a certain point on Enyo's tour, [[Elinor]] peels off to engage Vicania alone.

Gwyn spends his time in prayer, keeping his nose out of the day to day operations of the Estate.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] said she was interested in the control of the spider, the drow asked if he wanted to enter the training program that lasts for 2 to 3 years (or longer), becoming a member of the estate.

3 hours after we arrive, Lady [[Solral Dreedasesh]] shows up in a sweet carriage being pulled by 3 giant lizards.

We head to the Gazebo.

Lady Solral praises us for the swift completion of the job. [[Elinor]] mentions that while we did encounter some battle, that we went undetected in the entrance and exit of the pyramid, she has nothing to worry about.

Another carriage shows up. A youngster rushes out of the carriage, into the house, and then towards the Gazebo.

The Lady continues, asking us if we would consider additional service to the family.

[[Elinor]] declines, as we have pressing matters on the surface.

The young drow runs up, he hands her the backpack and says in Elvish "Here you go gramma"

Enyo gives Lady Soral the spider. Lady Soral hands the backpack to Enyo. The backpack weighs about 15 pounds. 

Soral says "Well, I guess I'll leave you to your business." She walks about 30' away from us, with Torreli. Where she asks the slave master to make the spider practice a strategic maneuver. 

Gwyn reaches in to the bag, thinking about the stone, and did pull out a crimson [[Stones of Power|stone of power]]. So we were presented with a [[Stones of Power]], and a Bag of Holding.

We make our way to the gate, [[Elinor]] waves. Torreli waves back. Vicania heads back to the house.

We leave the estate and ask [[Dranaste]] to take us to the camp we've stayed at a couple of times before. 

We ended the session on a battle 

- [[Elinor]] used Bardic Inspiration (1d8 inspiration)
