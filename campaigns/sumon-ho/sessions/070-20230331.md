Last session -
- Crossed a fissure after fighting some vulture-like monsters


This session:

- 300' past the fissure, we come to another bunch of rubble, and a new path.
- Kereshi and Enyo hear the voice of a woman who claims to have been trapped in the darkness for a long time
- We decide to head towards the voice :D
- We walk down the hallway and came to a locked door, which Elinor picked - after Kereshi hit it with a rock. Through the door is a large room, with a diorama made of stone to our right. The diorama depicts a scene of people worshipping the painting of a sorcerer behind it
- Enyo moves closer to investigate.
	- not a modern architecture used in the diorama
	- they note some mild dwarven influence
- Elinor casts detect magic. Nothing in the room appears to be magical.
- There are some stairs across the room from us that that go up 20' to a landing. The stairs continue to climb, every 20' is another landing. On the first landing there was a Stone that looked like it might at one point been used as a calendar.
	- Gwyn and Enyo decide to take the stone with them. then continue up 2 more flights of stairs.
- After climbing 80',  we come to a short hallway with a door. The hallway is only 10' long.
- Kereshi opens the door. Behind the door is a shrine, where there are torn tapestries, the room is covered in friezes that have been recently defaced - the recent defacement is at odds with the age of the building.
- [?] To this point we have seen no steps in the dust.
- There is a door across from the hallway, and a door to the right as we enter the room. The shrine is to the left. Enyo finds a defaced holy symbol.
- Gwyn tries to make out the deity the holy symbol is associated with, but is really only able to determine there were some slightly sun-like markings.
- Kereshi enters the door across the hall. She sees 4 stone sarcophagi, then immediately backs out, closing the door behind her.
- She moves to the door to the right, opening it, she finds another door. She goes to see if the door is locked, and the first door closes behind her (oh no!). The second door is not locked, and the first door didn't lock behind her.
- Enyo keeps the first door open for Brave Kereshi :)
- Stone blocks standing against the western and eastern walls, each block has a niche carved within it, and each of the niches have a canopic jar within them.
- There is a large stone sarcophagus in the middle of the room.
	- The lid of the sarcophagus is covered with a mosaic depicting an ancient city.
- Gwyn gives, I must say, a very moving and inspiring speech, motivating the party into action.
- Inspired by Gwyn's words, Kereshi charges into the room, pushing the lid off of the sarcophagus with a mighty heave. (Un)Luckily moving the lid had been made easier by an ancient spell, and the force of Kereshi's push was such that the lid was broken in twain, and she fell face-first into the sarcophagus.
- A booming voice is triggered that curses us for opening the tomb of Brysus of Kh'aem
	- Gwyn, Enyo, and Dranaste were shook by the voice (failed the CHA save and have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws)
- A sculpture of a sorcerous woman lies within. 
- Gwyn checks out the jars. The jars look old, the organs within them do not ðŸ¤® altogether, the jars seem to hold the organs of 4 hosts.
- The sarcophagus is on a black marble bier, it doesn't appear that it will move
- Enyo, after some thought, surmised that this was a fake tomb, a decoy. Likely intended to thwart grave robbers.

>[!info] We're cursed?!?
>Hi, John here, seems like I forgot that the party was cursed by liberating Soulstriker. This curse makes us easy to be tracked by the cult - whom I believe is the Agents of T'Loque

- Kereshi, in a rare moment of  remorse, uses Mending to fix the lid of the sarcophagus; then we go check out the other room.
- 4 stone sarcophagi mark the tombs of servants. Each lid has a sculpture of a robed human laying in repose. Kereshi no sooner places her hands on the lid of the sarcophagi than 4 ghosts scream into existence, surrounding us.

Roll initiative!

Round 1
- Ghost hits Kereshi
- Kereshi destroys one with massive blows
- Gwyn rebukes the remaining 3, turning 2
- Enyo moves forward to attack the one that was not turned

Round 2
- The turned ghosts disappear through the wall
- Kereshi kills the last remaining one


Kereshi speed searches the sarcophagi
- 2 bracelets (50g)
- 1 ceremonial ivory wand (25g)
- 1 onyx ring (50g)
- 1 silver necklace (250g)
- 1 ewer made of beaten gold (25g)
- 1 gold + platinum censer (250g)
- 1 walking stick of varnished yew with a golden handle, with a handle shaped like a scorion (Kereshi keeps it - worth 75g)

- While waiting for the ghosts to return, we discover one of the sarcophagi is movable. We move it, and find a hole leading down about 10'. Enyo believes this to be the entrance to the actual tomb of Brysus.
- We send Kereshi down.

>[!warning]
>A murderous creature with hate in her eyes, stands in the sarcaphagus and says "Finally! Your deaths will provide the catalyst I need to escape this place!"

- Enyo and Gwyn head down the hole to join Kereshi. There's not enough room for Dranaste to join us in the room.

Roll initiative #2

- Kereshi was attacked for 21hp
- Kereshi hits back
- Enyo green flame blades
- Gwyn flies in and casts Twilight Sancturary
- Kereshi drops the great axe and pulls out soulstriker

Then we proceed to wipe the floor with the baddies.


Searching the sarcophagus -

- withered body of a sorceress, looks like the statue from the other sarcophagus
- on top is a magic sword - the hilt is of a longsword, the blade is made of light - it's intelligent
- Enyo casts see invisibility
	- at the foot of the sarcophagus is an invisible stone chest
	- within the stone chest 
		- 4000 sp
		- 1200 gp
		- 11 gems X 50gp
		- pfilter of love
		- potion of greater healing
		- Necklace of fireballs with 3 beads left



- Gwyn casts Tiny Hut in the big room, and we take a long rest. During our downtime
	- Faith (Hun-Hoksa investigator) contacts me. Says they'll be waiting when we bring the stone to them.
	- Kereshi spends some time with her magic sword, and discovers that it's an intelligent sword named Dawnbringer.
		- Gwyn's note - She hasn't put the sword down since she found it, and there was some difficulty getting Kereshi to put it back in the scabbard so we could get some sleep.

Long rest

---

- The next day we make our way back to the path where we heard the voide the day before. Dranaste takes a minute to get his bearings, then leads us down one of the newly opened trails. Eventually we come to a tranquil lake, there are some wooden paddle boards we could use to cross the lake. There are small fish under the the surface that we can see in the light of Dawnbringer. Dranaste cautions us against drinking the water or swimming.
- There's a tunnel about 15' away, but would require us crossing some shallow part of the lake.
	- We use the boards to get across and enter the tunnel.
- We reach the [[Undermist]], and travel through it. Another day of travel takes us back to where we entered the Undermist. About 3 days have passed since Dawnbringer was found.
- We Cinnamon Roll back to the [[Chillin Tower]]. Dranaste heads back to the Passion Place, with our apologies to [[Olgann]] for not visiting this time around.
