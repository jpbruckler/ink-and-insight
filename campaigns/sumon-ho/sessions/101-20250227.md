## Stream

- Walking through the brush, a single monkey came out of the forest and started screaming at [[Orein]]
    - I cast Detect Thoughts, thinking a single monkey is odd, mayhaps it's not a beast. My spell failed, so it's just a beast
- Orein says there's about 10 apes alltogether. We decide to swing out around the band. I cast Pass Without a Trace.
- We camp for the night. Using Druidcraft, I check the weather and see it'll be mostly cloudy
- The next day is slightly rainy, and at the end of the day as we near the end of the forest, signified by a giant wall of vegetation.
    - There's ground shaking thunder and laughter and loud talking in a language that none of us understand
    - We send Orein up to the wall of vegetation to scout. As he steps into he, his disappears from our view.
    - When he returns he tells us about three mountain giants
    - We decide to sneak past with the aid of pass without a trace.
    - We go on for about another hour and Orein makes his tower
    - The giants keep up some noise throughout the night
- The next day we're in a pine forest, the air smells of it.
    - We make our way into a valley, rich with vegetation, bees, and an orchard. We all grab some apples
    - Orein stops us, just beyond the valley is a hulking figure, deep green skin, yellowed eyes, scanning for movement - a Troll
    - We take the Troll down, but as we do, several Gnolls appear. 
        - 2 are wearing leathers and fur, taking a high position
        - 6 others are running down the side of the valley, all taking shots. Their clothing/armor is patchwork
    - Enyo casts Lightning bolt, dropping 4 of the gnolls immediately
    - Another wave of gnolls comes over the hill and are dealt with
    - A 3rd wave breaches the hill, this time with the backup of a larger Gnoll, wearing chainmail and carrying a glaive. This monster of a Gnoll rushes Kereshi
    - 6 more Gnolls appear
