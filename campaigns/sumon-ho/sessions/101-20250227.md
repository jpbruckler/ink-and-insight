## Stream

- Walking through the brush, a single monkey came out of the forest and started screaming at [[Orein]]
    - I cast Detect Thoughts, thinking a single monkey is odd, mayhaps it's not a beast. My spell failed, so it's just a beast
- Orein says there's about 10 apes alltogether. We decide to swing out around the band. I cast Pass Without a Trace.
- We camp for the night. Using Druidcraft, I check the weather and see it'll be mostly cloudy
- The next day is slightly rainy, and at the end of the day as we near the end of the forest, signified by a giant wall of vegetation.
    - There's ground shaking thunder and laughter and loud talking in a language that none of us understand
    - We send Orein up to the wall of vegetation to scout. As he steps into he, his disappears from our view.
    - When he returns he tells us about three mountain giants
    - We decide to sneak past with the aid of pass without a trace.
    - We go on for about another hour and Orein makes his tower
    - The giants keep up some noise throughout the night
- The next day we're in a pine forest, the air smells of it.
    - We make our way into a valley, rich with vegetation, bees, and an orchard. We all grab some apples
    - Orein stops us, just beyond the valley is a hulking figure, deep green skin, yellowed eyes, scanning for movement - a Troll
    - We take the Troll down, but as we do, several Gnolls appear. 
        - 2 are wearing leathers and fur, taking a high position
        - 6 others are running down the side of the valley, all taking shots. Their clothing/armor is patchwork
    - Enyo casts Lightning bolt, dropping 4 of the gnolls immediately
    - Another wave of gnolls comes over the hill and are dealt with
    - A 3rd wave breaches the hill, this time with the backup of a larger Gnoll, wearing chainmail and carrying a glaive. This monster of a Gnoll rushes Kereshi
    - 6 more Gnolls appear


Session 100 (2/28/2025): In this storm, lightning is your friend

Highlights

*Rewind: As the party was preparing to visit the Master Druid, and hopefully begin their trip to the Barbed Mountains, the group was becoming ever concerned about Fuzula. She had been increasingly nauseous and light headed. Fuzula is an active ranger with a high stamina, so it was less concerned about her ability to recover than the time to do so. The prescription is just rest. The concern is that the group can’t wait. Tracking through the Ravaged Lands is not prone to “rest.” It is also not a place to operate when not functioning at your best, even when at Fuzula’s caliber. But no one wanted to leave without her even if Orein could function as the group’s scout. Ultimately, the decision was made because Fuzula said she is coming…period.

   But as the group made final preparations to step out of the Lavish Pumpkin, Fuzula received a Sending spell from Booster. Booster was headed to NuThornville in the morning on the caravan. He needed to talk to Fuzula and he wanted to do so in person. With much hemming and hawing, Fuzula decided to stay at the inn and rest up. With assurances from The Mace that he and his kin would look after her, the party headed out without their beloved scout. Everyone believed they would rejoin again soon.

For this session:

*The party set off for the day’s travel.

*Crossing a vast meadow the last couple of hours, you saw game animals, lions, and a few dozen gnolls in the distance. For the gnolls, neither group (the party nor the gnolls) was motivated to close the mile between you.

*Along the way, a lone monkey moves onto the trail. It has brown fur with streaks of orange fur down its arms. It appears to be a baboon, but closer to the size of a gorilla. The main party is just stepping through the vegetation as it growls in their direction. There is little doubt that it isn’t really alone.

*A failed Detect Thoughts spell told Olseris that it was a creature without language, probably a simple beast.

*Although it acted threateningly, it wasn’t approaching or attacking the party itself. The group decided to try to sneak around it to the south under the cover of a Pass without Trace spell, since Orein only sensed others to the north of the trail.

*As soon as they were off the trail, Kereshi had her echo rush in the other direction. It caused a start to the alpha baboon, but the animal did not give chase.

*After the 2nd day of travel is complete, rest is found in the summoned Rauha tower.

*A short thunderstorm raged that night, although it didn’t bother those sleeping in the tower. In the morning, the ground was wet and a few branches were down. The first couple hours of travel included occasional misty rain and light showers. After 10 am, the rain stopped but the sky stayed dark. The sky seemed to clear up midday.   

*The sun begins to set on a beautiful, but stress-filled, day. Although seeing several threats at a distance, your day has ultimately been uneventful with no little thanks to Orein’s scouting ability. You are in a forest with a thick canopy, causing the ground to have limited vegetation; and limited cover. Ahead you a few hundred feet can be seen a wall of vegetation signifying an area not enveloped in canopy. The blue sky is starting to show through. A sudden rumble reverberates through the land.

*Scouting ahead, Orein spied three 12’ tall giants with a slight adolescent look to them. The two males were wrestling on the ground at this point, while the girl seemed to taunt them in an unknown language. The males were bald and all had reddish-brown skin. Other than their height and skin color, they looked like somewhat thinner hill giants. Orein said they were mountain giants.

*The party decided to sneak past them and put some distance between them. It was easily done with the wall of vegetation and the giants’ preoccupation.

*Later that night, they could be heard from the tower until well after midnight.

*The party began their 4th day of travel since landing as wind in the Ravaged Lands. They still expected to get to the region of Majesty’s keep 3.5 days before Chief Inspector Farr, which should give them plenty of time to find the keep given information gleaned in Enyo’s research.

*The thick canopy of green leaves is overhead, as it has been most of the day. Light filters through here and there giving life to vegetation and animals on the forest floor. The air smells of pine here, as the last few miles have been dominated by the large needled trees. Thin patches of short grass have been prevalent, but it is particularly sparse in this area where a blanket of fallen needles covers much of the ground.

   The path you follow veers into a small valley, nearly 100 feet deep but nearly a mile long. Orein disappears into it cautiously. You reach the edge and see the length of the valley. The path slithers down its slope about 30 feet where it flattens out in a bit of a plateau or level area running most of its length. Near the far end the slope on the north continues to rise into a flower-covered hillock. The southern slope has a gap in it, where the valley opens into an extended area of lowlands. The valley you now traverse is open to the bright sky. The slope's soil is rich, but not deep enough to support the large trees of the forest, but it has plenty of smaller trees. Bees buzz through an orchard on the slope and level as dozens of apple trees intermingle with a few bearing pears and plums.      

   Two hundred feet ahead of you, Orein takes a moment to grab a nearby apple and takes a bite. Even at this distance you can see his smile before he runs a sleeve over his mouth to remove the juices of his treat. He grabs two more and slips them into his pouch before moving on. Other party members also grabbed some of the refreshing fruit.

   Orein halts suddenly, raising a hand to stop since you are close enough to see him. His eyes narrow as he scans the landscape ahead, grasping his bow tightly. Nestled among the boulders at the base of the valley, just beyond the orchard, something stirs. A hulking figure, partially obscured by a massive rock, shifts its weight, its long, gnarled fingers curling against the stone. A ragged, foul-smelling hide drapes over its form, its deep green skin mottled with dirt and old scars.

   The creature’s broad, misshapen head tilts slightly as if listening, its yellowed eyes darting across the terrain. It doesn’t seem to have noticed you—yet. But its breathing is heavy, uneven, like a beast on the run. It lifts its head above the rock it is using for cover. As it does, Orein ducks behind a bush at the base of a plum tree.

*Recognizing the troll as a dangerous and typically bloodthirsty monster, Olseris called to it “Hey, what are you looking for.” If the creature was not violent, so be it. But if it was, it would be dispatched. As the creature stood up clearly intending to take harmful action, the party attacked to eliminate the threat. It started with Kereshi’s javelin of lightning.

*Unbeknownst to the party, the hurt troll had been running from a gnoll band that was hunting it. The group of 20 gnolls and 6 gnoll hunters pursuing the troll came over the ridge into the valley. Much to the advantage of the party, they arrived in 3 waves that were largely grouped in a line. The third wave included the pack leader.

*Positioning herself for maximum effect, Enyo utilized 3 lightning bolts, including one of 4th level. With this immense firepower, tearing through flesh and trees alike, the gnolls morale broke after the pack leader fell.

*The party provided healing and care to the injured party members before setting off.

*A few hours later, avoiding any serious hostilities, Orein summoned the Rauha tower for the evening’s respite.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 10 pm on Month 8/Day 7
