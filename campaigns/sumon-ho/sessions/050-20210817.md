## Session Log

- [[Danger Inc.]]  conferred with each other on their current predicament. To trust or not to trust; it always seems to come back to that.
- [[Olgann]]  returned and cast a spell to appear as a human with his proportions, but a face that looks strikingly like [[Elinor]] (as if her brother)
- [[Olgann]]  tells them they don't look much worse for the wear "despite a ferocious quarrel."
- He states his compatriot [[Simmer]] contacted [[Claude]] ([[Hun-Hoksa]]'s Physic Negotiator) who vouched for them. He said [[Hun-Hoksa]] asked for him to help them if he would. He said he would provide information that helps them pursue the crimson [[Stones of Power|Power Stones]] on three conditions…

1. They never possess more than 2 at a time
2. They turn one of the recovered stones over to him for safe keeping
3. The party gives him 14 gp and 7 sp for each stone he tells them about.

- When [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] asked how she can be sure she can trust him, he said 'how can we ever be sure of that. Maybe you can contact one of [[Hun-Hoksa]]'s minions who have met me; [[Claude]], [[Leoris]], [[Freddie]].'
- He gives them another half an hour to think about it. During that time, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] used Sending spell to contact [[Freddie]]. [[Freddie]] quickly responded '[[Olgann]]  is shady. Not sure I would "trust" him, but he can be trusted with the stones.'
- [[Olgann]]  tells them about [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]]'s [[Stones of Power|Stone of Power]] guarded by [[Olgann]] . He tells the story how [[Glorgona]], [[Majesty]], and the [[Deadstone Giants]] tried to send the dwarven city of [[Keg Torum]] into Hell. Eventually, they attracted the attention of a heroic Drow and a pair of competing Heros, namely [[Augustus Volgo]] and [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]] Martin.
- [[Olgann]]  tells them about the dwarves [[Stones of Power|Stone of Power]] probably still in the vaults of [[Strolbren Tower]]. The [[Strolbren Tower]] was built by the dwarven artisan Ragbek Roughbeard over a century ago as a forward watch tower for [[Keg Torum]], the southern city and stronghold of the dwarves. During the [[Northern Invasion]], the dwarves abandoned the tower and withdrew their forces to the city's defenses. While war raged, a human lord from what is now the [[Conquered Lands]], mustered people to quickly build a fort on a high hill overlooked by the tower. Within a year of its completion, the fort and tower fell. These days, the fort is a central feature of the hobgoblin city of [[Kondraroc]]. Hobgoblins maintain the tower to watch for invading armies and massive monsters. But [[Olgann]]  suspects neither the human lord nor the hobgoblin sentry were able to get into the vault.
- [[Olgann]]  told the party the [[Demons Door|Demon's Door]] is up the trail from [[Strolbren Tower]]. It will be quite a trek through the [[Ravaged Lands]] to get to them.
- [[Olgann]]  tells them about [[Grinvah Dreedasesh]]'s [[Stones of Power|Stone of Power]] probably still in the [[Underdark]]. It is believed that he took it to his home estate. Despite being over 50 years ago, [[Olgann]]  thinks it is likely to still be within the [[Dreedasesh estate]]. He also mentioned a spy he knew ([[Aleashia]]  - she has some magical device to infiltrate the drow) was captured north of the tower by hill giants. It was a few months ago, so he doesn't know their current state. 
- [[Olgann]] 's intense praise of [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]] has some in the party believing he is actually [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]].
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] were allowed to follow him to where he stored his treasures in the back of the main room. While he crossed over the blue line to enter it, his spell dropped and he no longer looked like [[Elinor]].
- His "sister" [[Elinor]] feigned being taken aback when she wasn't invited to the party. [[Olgann]]  ended up inviting her.
- While most of [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] said 'You're betrayal failed. We are still alive.' [[Averos]] responded, "I have no idea what you are talking about."
- An orc from the [[Skull Crusher]] clan thought he caught [[Elinor]] cheating at dice. There were four [[Skull Crusher|Skull Crushers]] at the party.
- A [[hobgoblin warlord]] was present named [[Grudanol]] who is a mean brute. He backhanded and bloodied an orc that was helping with the guests. [[Olgann]]  came off his chair up to the warlord. Both [[Grudanol]]'s elite captains pulled their weapons but hesitated to attack; one just looked nervous while the other looked to [[Grudanol]] for orders. [[Olgann]]  ignores them, walking within striking distance with his attention on [[Grudanol]]. "The help" is under his protection during this event. [[Olgann]]  forbade [[Grudanol]] from using the ecstasy cage. [[Grudanol]] decided he didn't want to use it anyway. Once resolved, [[Olgann]]  became friendly again.  
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] follows.      
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]'s choice, her persistence prods him. Since he told [[Hun-Hoksa]] he would help (with information), he got off his chair.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] concerned the hobgoblins would goad her and she couldn't ignore that, [[Olgann]]  said he would tell the [[hobgoblin warlord]] that he required her to stand down.
- As [[Olgann]]  returns to the main room, the [[drow elite warrior]]'s guards were positioning themselves to surround [[Asuilo]]; the female drow playing cards when the party first arrived. [[Olgann]]  wants to know if the drow leader's appearance is a betrayal and makes it clear that [[Asuilo]] is under his protection within the [[Passion Place|Ecstasy Tunnels]]. The drow leader apologizes for any misunderstanding that may have happened. While [[Asuilo]] is a marked woman, he would not think of carry out her arrest in [[Olgann]] 's lair. "No offense to the master of this house was intended." His deference to [[Olgann]]  is palpable, although [[Olgann]]  returns a respectful nod.
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]]. Neither of them recognized him, but he seemed to recognize them. He had a snake head tattoo on the back of his left hand.
