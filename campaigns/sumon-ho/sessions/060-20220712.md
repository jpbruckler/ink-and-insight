## Session Log


3 major Mage factions
1. [[🗺️ Arcane Academy]] - [[Booster]] is a member
2. [[Battle Mage Assembly]] - most popular in the [[Jorenian Kingdom]]
3. [[Worg Arcadia]] - linked to the [[Volgo Family]]

We decide to make our way to the [[Dreedasesh estate]] to retrieve the [[Stones of Power|Stone of Power]] there. First stop: the [[Passion Place]] 

Outside the [[Passion Place]] is an orc who mentioned that [[Jasper Martin]] is S Q U A R E and lives nearby.

In the main hall are a number of people. There are 4 statues (these are new) on the side walls, near the middle, partway down. The statues are "automation" - Now that he has the [[Amulet of Kwallip]], he thought it would be a good time to setup some automaton help.

Statues are humanoid in shape, but not terribly detailed. Stand about 7' tall. One of them has a Greatsword on it's back. The other has an Axe in it's hand. Each statue appears to be in one piece. One holds a large scimitar, and the other holds warhammer.

4 [Hobgoblins](https://ddb.ac/monsters/hobgoblin) in miltary gear
4-5 [Orcs](https://ddb.ac/monsters/orc)
Some bandit bros fighting with the [Wyvern](https://ddb.ac/monsters/wyvern)

[[Dranaste]] alishia and Misty are playing cards. [[Elinor]] joins them. [[Dranaste]] says we have to get through the [[Undermist]]
See "[[Undermist Travel]]"


[[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] approaches. 
- acknowledged that the Saphire and Emerald Stones of Power are his, and 
- He's working out a deal at the [[Dreedasesh estate]]. There's a riddle that supposedly tells the location of 3 artifacts. [[Olgann]] would like us to retrieve them 

[[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] tells [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] about the statues and the request from [[Olgann]]. We decide to talk to [[Elinor]] to see if she can get a copy of the riddle, since she is a bard and has an interest in retrieving legends and such.

The riddle: 

>[!quote]
>Search ye far or search ye near
You’ll find no trace of the three
Unless you follow instructions clear
For they abide with me.
>
>North past forest, farm and furrow
>You must go to the feathered mound
>Then down away from the sun you’ll burrow
>Forget life, forget light, forget sound.
> 
> To rescue Wave, you must do battle
>With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble
>Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle
>Lies Flelm, past water-spouts double.
>
>Blast-favor yet remains to be won
>Underneath inverted ziggurat.
>That garnered, think not that you’re done
>For now you’ll find you are caught
>
>I care not, former owners brave
>What heroes you seek to hire.
>Though mighty, I’ll make each one my slave
>Or send him to the fire.

We decided to head to the [[Dreedasesh estate]], in the [[Underdark]].

Travel 1/2way to tower in mist (wind walker). Ritual cast Leomund's Tiny Hut. We long rest, then use the prayer bead to windwalk again, getting about 100 yards past the tower. Roughly 3pm

Prayer bead @17:00 -- 8 hours --> stop at 03:00 and rest until 07:00 (dawn), then Prayer Bead --> 15:00


Don's Notes:

 - [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] hooked them up with lots of pancakes.
 - After a dry, warm night’s sleep in the only bedroom in the tower, the party headed back to [[Olgann]]’s home. 
 - The uneventful trip brought them to the tunnel guarded by the same ogre as before and a very dim-witted and unrefined orc. Still, the passcode gained them entry. The orc complained about [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] later claimed to [[Olgann]] that the ‘orc at the door’ was ‘praising [[Jasper Martin|Jasper]] to high heaven’ [or something similar].
  - In [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] went to pay respect to [[Olgann]].
  - [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] left, [[Olgann]] stated that he could use their assistance. He was making a deal with a business partner for an exchange of services. The partner had a riddle that talked of three items. In exchange for a magical service for an important person to [[Olgann]], [[Olgann]] would see to it that the remaining items were retrieved for the partner. [Note: [[Olgann]] mentioned the riddle talks of three items. However, the business partner believes one item has been recovered by another party due to historical references to it. So [[Danger Inc.|Danger Incorporated]] is only expected to find 2 items when they get there. That detail should come out when the party returns for the riddle and the location of the “feathered mound.”]
  - The party said they would retrieve the items after they visit the [[Dreedasesh estate]] to collect the Crimson [[Stones of Power|Stone of Power]] found there.
  - Aleashia said she felt healthy enough despite the malformed limb that was going to be a problem. She confided in [[Elinor]] that [[Olgann]] said he was trying to work out a magical solution. She wasn’t supposed to tell anyone, or get her hopes up, because he wasn’t sure it could be pulled off.
  - After collecting Dronaste, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] used Wind Traveler on the party to make it about half way back to the trail behind [[Strolbren Tower]]. They spent the night in the magical hut.
  - The next morning at dawn they used Wind Traveler again to make it the rest of the way.
  - [[Danger Inc.|Danger Incorporated]] landed about 100 yards down the trail past the [[Strolbren Tower]].

> The players (and characters) spent a lot of time talking about what they know and what their plans are for going forward. The DM also clarified some information, including that [[Elinor]] is academically familiar with the 4 Volgo Houses and specifically the House of Silver from her entertainer days. I won’t try to capture all that information here. If someone wants to reply to this recap with information, for example the expected courses of action/goals, I can add it to the record.
