7 orcs were in the Chillin Tower when we got there
Gwynn healed them, asked them not to hit the Goblins. told the goblins if they MUST pee in some mead, to do it out of sight.

Mischief managed, we head to the [[Passion Place]] to talk to [[Olgann]] about presuming to use the Chillin Tower without talking to us..

I cast Enhance Ability: Eagle's Splendor on Kereshi as we walk into the Passion Place. There are 3 hobgoblins at the entrance. We say to them "I kneel with the Master" and they let us pass. As we walk through the portcullis and into the main room, there are 8 doors, 4 to a side. The first to last door on the right side is jammed open and people were in there eating and talking. We continue to the oil room, and cross the planks.

The Wyvern is still here
Something new:
- 6 - 9' tall automations are there

As is typical, there are a number of people here. Dranaste his sister, and another drow woman are playing cards.

Olgann is back by the Wyvern.
8 Humanoids (7 humans, 1 half-orc) playing a game. There's a 7' tall wooden disk witha bullseye on it. The game is for a person to stand in front of the disc, while another throws axes. 2 are hurt. I use healing word on them.

Olgann makes his way to us and we start some chit-chat. Olgann doesn't have a lot of time, so we shoot the shit about Dranaste very shortly. The interaction with Kereshi and Olgann goes not so great. It's clear that Olgann could give a shit less about what we think. He's the cock of the walk, the master of the passion place, and he'll make the decisions that he makes. He does offer us some jerky.

Gwynn gets some jerky on the way out. The people in there stop talking when we enter the room. There's some tense conversation. I take some jerky and an apple.

Dranaste, his sister (Alecia with the Magic Hat) and the other Drow (Misty) come to escort us back to the Chillin Tower. We have some conversation about what's the norm at the Passion Place.

Gwynn talks to Dranaste and Alecia about how Olgann came to power, his sphere of influence, etc. There's something about his Aura that makes people feel like they can be themselves, so long as you respect the rules and can read Olgann's mood. Olgann is chaotic in nature, but he's not going to kill you - you always have the freedom to leave if you don't like it, but if you stay you follow the rules. His moods can change on a dime.

When we get to the Chillin Tower, Alecia stops and says "Well we should do hugs now...". She stops about 150' away from the Tower. 

We have some discussion out of character about why the stop. There's 

When we walked into the tower, Eleanor was talking with 3 of the Orcs, they were regaling her with stories. Gwynn went to bed.

In the morning I cast Create Food and Water

Aghbore is the Lieutenant. Their captain died in the fighting. 
- offered him some employment, serving us as some extra muscle
- I told Kereshi this was the offer that I made. 
- Aghbore needs to discuss it with the group a bit.
- Kereshi made some "conversation"
- In a week I'll use Sending to get Aghbore's answer.

We cinnamon roll out. Fly for 8 hours, make camp, then take off again.

As we fly to the Mountain Sanctum, there are 3 people walking up the mountainside. All 3 are wearing the robes of Hun-Hoksa, one of them seems out of place, having been caring for themselves, looks like a wretch.

NW edge of a 30' long flat spot in the mountainside. There's an alter here, there's a 5' wide path alongside the mountain heading to the Sanctum. The air is cool, and a light mist hangs in the air, but the Sanctum is dry, and we feel the sun on our face, even though there is cloud cover.

The Sanctum overlooks Aimesland.

We head down the path. Standing at the doorway are Day-dove and Rachaim. Day-dove is one of the guardian physics. Rachaim is a dwarven male. As we walk up we present the challenge coins.

Alim - only a greeting among friends
Alum - is the appropriate response 

The hallway has a turn in it (defensive measure to slow down anyone rushing in), then into a Great Hall. An area of the hall has a bunch of fineries, food, etc. After about 50' it opens into a Great Room with a huge ceiling. A platform in the middle, and there's an opening in the roof that opens into the clouds. We get the impression that Hun-Hoksa "sleeps" in the clouds, rather than staying in the material plane.

7' tall, slender person - looks kind of half-elven, but tall for a half-elf.

Faithe is on the platform.

There are 3 "Tiglars" in total - a creation of Don - only 2 are there now
- Sweetheart
- Lady
- Braun

LEVEL UP TIME - WOOP WOOP
And another decision to make -
- A gift from Hun-Hoksa
	- ASI
		- This does not mean a feat, just a classic ASI
	- OR
	- Innate ability to cast a 3rd level spell - Call Lightning, or Mass Healing Word
	- One player can choose daylight
