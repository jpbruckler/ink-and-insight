## Session Log

We begin the session inside the pyramid

There are bars (like monkey bars) all through the area, we surmise that the bars are for the simian inhabitants. There are also some cushi.ons hanging from chains,   and it would appear the bars are configured in such a way that they could be used to get into the cushions.

There's a 4-way about 50' from us, with a pole that stretches from floor to ceiling.

- in a 10' corridor, with a 30' wide room to the left, has some plants in there (we think they're fake)
- Enyo casts locate object, it's below us to some degree, and wayyyy off to the left

It seems likely the figurine is down the hole.

Gwyn doffs his armor.

Fuzula casts "Pass without a trace" via her bracers again.

As we're discussing how to put the halfling down the hole in the floor, 2 armored simian/human like (think planet of the apes) pass the end of the corridor ([[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] and Fuzula saw them)

She's able to see that the stone floor is roughly 20' below us. She describes that below us is a very large area with lots of plants growing, and a bit of a smell of decay. Large cavernous area, likely a few hundred feet in length. There are a couple of large apes roughly 30' away (they are taller than the 6' tall weeds)

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] steps on Fuzula's hands while they're climbing down - only because John rolled a 1 on her Athletics check.

Enyo - stealth of 11, and athletics check of 9. Able to make their way down the pole, though not detected, they definitely weren't quiet

Gwyn - stealth of 17, athletics of 12, also makes it down the pole without being seen.

The cavern we enter is about 300' long, 100' wide. 2 doors at the end

I use eyes of night to give everyone 300' of darkvision

When we get within 90' of the apes, we hear a voice, like a 3rd creature speaking. We cannot see the speaker.

Rock walls down here are maroon/deep red. 

We send Fuzula, with a 30 sneak roll, to check the door and get it open. She goes stiff, then goes into the room. After a couple of minutes, she motions us forward.

The party heads through the door, quiet as church mice.

The room is 100' long, 30' wide. We enter on the left side of the room. When we first walk in, we see 10 'simian warriors' in the room. We can tell after a second that they're not real, they're "preserved". They're lined up along the sides of the walls.

[[Elinor]] cast detect magic. Don mentioned the walls are red stone again, and that the walls are faintly glowing magical.

When [[Elinor]] gets within 30' of the door, she notes the door is magical, along with a small spot to the side of the door is also magical. [[Elinor]] investigates the magical spot, and is able to discern the imprint of a paw.

I use stone shape to make an archway past the magical door. 

The next room is a 10 x 20 room. within this room, there are 4 small tables. On the far side of the room there is an iron door. The far wall, and all the walls around it are red stone. The iron door is magical. There is also a doorway leading off to the left. The hall to the left is pitch black - which is odd for the pyramid. 

> Don gave us a boon with information about the red stone. It's largely to keep things that dig from getting past it. The stone is harder than normal stone, and is resistant to magic.

Each of the 4 tables has an object on it. 

1. The spider figurine
2. Cloth, folded up
3. Fine dagger
4. Lizard figurine (magical)

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] uses her extendo pole to poke the tables. He rolled a nat 1 for the first poke, and knocks the table over. The figurine skitters across the ground, coming to rest under the table with the dagger on it.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] heads to the lizard figurine - and is attacked!

ROLL INITIATIVE!

A tongue flies out from the pitch dark hallway and hits [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] stands her ground, the tongue detaches as she is not to be dissuaded.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] smash.

Gwyn casts Faerie Fire on the toady.

The toad bites [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] is now grappled.

[[Elinor]] uses psychic lance and incapacitates it.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] is able to break free, and uses 2nd wind, then action surges, hitting our froggy friend twice.

Gwyn was able to kill the frog - likely only because Fuzula wasn't in battle with me.

[[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] grabs the lizard figurine, Gwyn gets the spider figurine and the cloth.

We cinnamon roll out :)

We make our way via gas to the [[Dreedasesh estate]].
