## Session Overview

### Summary

> [!abstract]
> I need to compose a song about how legendarily difficult Lyriena's vault was to get to, well guarded, crafty traps.

Map things:
- need to map out the storage room
- change the fireplace
- get the storage room and upper floor maps on the same file


We need to head to some keep near Pridesville, in "the mountains".

[[Lyriena]] likely has some information about the people at the keep, and potentially the location itself. We don't really know who, besides Chief Inspector Farr.

## Stream

low wall that goes around the estate, and in the yard is the woman that recognized the party and a larger guy herding some goats

Crystal is the one that recognized us, she's The Hammer's daughter. She mentions she's a bit of an entrepeneur when not working nights at the inn. She's helping to maintain Paikalla. 

People bought the Paikalla, it was too big, they turned it into an Inn, then sold it cheap, the 2nd owner used it to sell illicit substances.

Olseris has an idea - buy The Paikalla, and get Crystal to run it.

We head to the Courthouse to meet with Captain Winters. He's in the records room.

The city is considering gifting The Paikalla to the party, pending the capture and return of Chief Inspector. 2 conditions - 
- return it to working order, it would be about 7,000gp to bring it up to code
- we would have to properly maintain it for at least 5 years

Part of the problem is that it's a bit off the beaten path.

We could also get the baking lady to work there to sell pastries and whatnot. We could potentially run it as a tavern, or a small inn, etc. Anyway, passive income.

A permanent teleportation circle would be 15k gp in costs.

In exchange for the purchase of a Capybara, I was able to convince Kereshi to dress up as Lyriena and hired an actor to play the part of an infiltrator. Together they act out the entire story in perfect harmony. Our performance is so in-sync and well acted out that it gathers a crowd, and people don't leave.

Many folks 

As we head back to the lavish pumpkin, we do pass some groups of people that were at the performance and were retelling the story to folks on the street - so the plan worked.

As we get closer to the Lavish Pumpkin, we're approached by [[Lyriena]], one of the people that left the performance was telling Lyriena about it.

We speak in Elvish. She doesn't know where the keep is, but the name of the Wizard is Majesty Jr.

His father, a warlock, [[Majesty]] sr. did extensive work with the druegar and the giants.It took 3 heroes to stop Majesty and Glorgana. Majesty Jr. now owns his father's keep in the Barbed Mountains.

[[The 3 Heroes]]

I'll get Kereshi up to speed back at the Lavish Pumpkin.

[[Tsakor]] comes back to help.

Enyo, having the name of the Warlock, goes to research the keep at the public library, and takes the book I stole back from [[Lyriena]] to return it to the Library.



Session 98 (11/21/2024): Wrapping up some reconnaissance

Note: This was a partial session

Highlights

*The party got word that the Master Druid could not cast his travel spell today. He would be prepared to discuss casting the spell for Orein in the morning.

*While Fuzula searched for her Willowshade Oil with Enyo, Kereshi and Olseris arrived at the Lavish Pumpkin.

*It had been bugging Olseris that he couldn‚Äôt place the young women cleaning in the damaged house/inn despite that she seemed to recognize some of the party.

*Kereshi and Olseris returned to find the woman and a large man observing goats eating the lawn. As one tried to jump the wall, the woman was trying to keep it in while the man watched on.

-Olseris went over and helped keep it in. He found the woman

-They found the woman was Crystal Mattel, daughter of Michael ‚ÄúThe Mace‚Äù Mattel. While she works as a waitress and occasional bartender at night for her father, she has a side business during the day.

-She is contracted to the city to maintain the Paikalla after it was confiscated following the raid of the place. It is her entrepreneurial spirit she learned from her dad. Although he wants her to stay in the family business, she wants to provide more for her clients is a steward-like setting. That‚Äôs why she (and her dad) like her on the night shift where she keeps everything running smoothly.

-The original owners who converted it from a house to an inn called it ‚Äú[[üó∫Ô∏è Paikalla|The Spot]].‚Äù After they couldn‚Äôt make ends meet, the buyers renamed it with the local dialect to Paikalla.

*Olseris asked if she knew what/if the city was going to sell it for. Crystal didn‚Äôt know, but she did know the trial recently ended which made the buildings fully confiscated.

*Kereshi knew Captain Winters was headed to the courthouse when they parted ways, so they headed to find him.

*When asked whether Paikalla would be sold inexpensive allowing good adventurers to buy it and Crystal‚Äôs business to advance, Captain Winters looked odd.

-Captain Winters said he was in discussions with Steward Mark Blents (as in, the City Stewart) via Winter‚Äôs supervisor. Steward Blents may award The Paikalla to the party for no charge for their quelling of the terror and if they return with Chief Inspector Farr. There would also be 2 conditions. 1- They must return it to working order, which will take about 7,000 gp. 2- They must properly maintain it for at least 5 years. After which time they can do what they want with it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be maintained specifically as a home or an inn, it is up to the party.

-Since they had this conversation, Captain Winters said he planned to tell his supervisor that it was discussed.

-If they are given the Paikalla, they would need to decide how to title it.

*Olseris and Kereshi went to the Marred Cask and Tasty Mead tavern for Olseris to perform in front of it.

-Olseris offered to purchase a pet for Kereshi if she would assist by playing Lyriena.

-Olseris also hired an actor to be the intruder.

-Olseris gave a masterful performance, enhanced by the incredible acting by Kereshi and her partner.

-The audience was moved and awestruck. It was a very memorable performance. Few people left other than to get a drink at a nearby tavern (not the MCTM, as the closed as the performance began)

*While heading back to the Lavish Pumpkin, Lyriena and her bodyguards stopped to talk to Olseris and Kereshi.

-An onlooker of the performance had told her of the quality job and message.

-She wasn‚Äôt pleased that the delerium was gone, but still respected the abilities of the party.

-During the conversation she also learned that Olseris took the component book and planned to return it to the library.

-Olseris tried to get Lyriena to give him information on the location of Chief Inspector Farr, his destination, or the person who hired her to hold the delerium. He pointed out that if the party eliminated the source it would be safer for her.

-She would only agree if Olseris agreed to ‚Äòowe her a favor.‚Äô He eventually did.

-Farr was delivering one of the books, as the employer already had the other one. Farr was to return with payment. At that time, she would turn over the delerium. She wasn‚Äôt certain if he would deliver it, personally or pay someone else.

-As far as the one who hired her to hold the delerium, ‚ÄúHis name is Majesty Jr. I don‚Äôt know where his keep is, but I know it is in the Barbed Mountains on the other side of the Ravaged Lands. His father, an infamous warlock, did extensive work with the Duergar and the giants.‚Äù He lives in his father‚Äôs keep.

*The party and their bard recalled, a female Duergar named Glorgona devised a plan to decimate the dwarven city of Keg Torum. She discovered, with the assistance of a particularly potent Knight of the Night tiefling called Majesty, a ritual that would utilize crimson Stones of Power to transport the dwarven city into the Nine Hells. Glorgona, with help from Majesty and a group of Deadstone giants, set her plans in motion. They were defeated by Grinvah Dreedasesh and a pair of competing Heros, namely Augustus Volgo and Jasper Martin. ¬†

*Kereshi and Olseris returned to the Lavish Pumpkin to await their friends.

*After Fuzula and Enyo returned, Olseris and Enyo headed to the library.

*Although the building had just closed, the worker remembered Enyo from her days working with the Aimesville sage Henry. They let the pair enter for Olseris to generously return the stolen book and Enyo to do an hour‚Äôs research.

*Enyo found a reference to Majesty‚Äôs keep decades ago. If the Junior does indeed reside in his father‚Äôs keep, the landmarks will be invaluable in speeding up the search for the keep.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 10 pm on Month 8/Day 2
