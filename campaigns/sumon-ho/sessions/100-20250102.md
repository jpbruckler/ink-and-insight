## Stream

- Planning session
    - Ideas from Don
        - Could become more urban centered around [[üó∫Ô∏è Paikalla|The Spot]]
        - Lots of potential for doing additional work with [[Michael Winters|Captain Winters]]
        - Or, move to the [[Underdark]] with a focus on the Dreedasesh
        - Also potentials to build up the [[Stone Tooth]], [[üó∫Ô∏è Paikalla|The Spot]], the [[Chillin Tower]]
            - Maybe a quest for an item that would allow binding to additional place for teleportation
        - Powerful entities
            - [[Hun-Hoksa]]
            - [[Olgann]]
            - [[SLD]]
            - [[Jasper]]
                - Is on the Pantheon list
                - He would have many goals, one of which would be to expand recognition of his name, and maybe also what happened to [[Grinvah Dreedasesh]]
                - His personality is one of a Knightly Wizard
            - Misquiet
            - [[Sutamo]] (more [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] than anyone in the party)

We ultimately settled on becoming a regional power in our own right, building up Stone Tooth.
