There was also 3k gold in the coin purse.

Church of Surma --> [[Vankilaan Hall]]

Phallon would like a share of something other than gold in exchange for the portable hole.
Tsakor always wanted a portable hole.

We camp on the other side of the realm. 

We break camp in the morning, put the boat in the portable hole, and then we cinnamon roll out. We fly along the river, enjoying not having to tangle with the river monsters. We saw a demon in the distance as we went, but he either didn't notice us, or wasn't interested in us.

We travel along, eventually making it back to [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula Fastbritches]].

The following is a recap of what Fuzula experienced:

[[Ajax]] is at the hall largely because it's the "family business". 

There are 3 kinds of wolf-like creatures at the hall.

- wargs - very intelligent, devious, would have no real desire to befriend Fuzula
- giant wolves - like, dire wolves. They're pretty closely aligned with the politics of the pack, they don't want to get on the bad side of the wargs
- regular wolves - the pack matters to them, but they're at the bottom of the pack, so they will spend some time with Fuzula

While we were away, several demons attacked the hall. Fuzula joined in with Ajaz and the Wight Masters to defend the hall.

She also espied another entity that looked like another wight master. He had a symbol of a white diamond with a red circle. There was also a mahagony horse with the same symbol on the flanks; the symbol looked like a birthmark, not like it was paint.

Fuzula did walk up to this guy and ask who he was, he gave Fuzula his name and then kind of waved her away saying "...but I'm busy right now, little girl."

One of the Wight Masters wears a red tunic and red boots. She's able to work out that he's like a sergeant/captain of the guard. Surma is often depicted as having red boots, so wearing them is a great honor, and something that's earned.

Back to us:

- We roll in, changing back out of the mist about 1/4 mile away from the hall.
- As soon as we revert, Phallon says "Excuse me!" and then hurriedly takes off towards the hall.
- We see there's a mahagony horse, with a white diamond on the its shoulder
- As we come up to the building, we see the Wight Masters sparring
- Fuzula is near Ajax, who's leaning on the wall beneath a stained glass portrait of Surma called "The Bringer of Peace"
- The sparring looks pretty serious - full contact with blunted weapons
- One of the guys, who had fancy armor, starts walking our way saying to the dude in red boots "Hey boots, take over".
- The fancy boy goes to [[Phallon]] and they salute each other
	- Phallon: "My Lord, I didn't know that you were coming!"
	  Fancy army boy: "Well, I've heard of your companions."
- Gwyn, Tsakor, and Enyo heading for Ajax/
- Phallon introduces the Fancy armor boy as "Misquiet"
	- Misquiet had heard of Kereshi's prayer, having been told by Surma himself. There's some discussion from Misquiet about how it's terrible that his gifts were taken away.
	- He tells Kereshi that if she were to take the upper levels of the [[Stone Tooth|Stone Tooth]]. He also says that he's guarantees that if she were to take the keep, warriors would definitely come to defend it.
	- Misquiet is a Hero of Surma
	- Tsakor steps up to offer some guidance to be careful.
	- Kereshi says "As much as your offer tempts me, I won't bend the knee to anyone."
	- Misquiet offers to introduce Tsakor and I to Sutamo
		- Gwyn says he'll take him up on the offer
		- Tsakor asks if he'd owe Misquiet anything - Misquiet says no, we would not owe him anything.
	- I let Phallon know he can go observe Misquiet
	- 


Cast sending to Freddie 
- we destroyed 3, olgann has 2, 1 is unaccounted for. What do.

Kereshi thinks taking out the 3 is enough to stop the cult
- Mike thinks if Antwon isn't high enough on the chain of command, we just kicked stones at a dragon
Fuzula wonders if Olgann is a threat
- Don reminded us that Olgann didn't want the other stone, he's aware of the power.
- Also that the cult only needed 2 sites, a 3rd would be a benefit if there was at least 30 souls, less than that would likely need more stones/souls. Seems like they need more souls to actually do the job.

Do we know how many souls they've taken so far?
- the 2nd site had ~15 souls
- the 1st site we don't know

After some discussion, the party agrees that the primary party objective is to find the last stone. The one we're looking for went to [[Augustus Volgo|Augustus Volgo]]. Ajax is a direct descendant. Fuzula offers to go butter him up. (John from later this session says: we actually decided not to go to the Abyss, and instead try to find the demon that Kereshi released back into our realm, then chasing down the cult).

Fuzula talks to Ajax 
- Augustus Volgo is Ajax's brother
- Ajax has seen the stone at Vankilaan Tower
- He tells Fuzula that Surma owed a demon, and the stone was given to Kali (one of The Three)
- Kali is in the Abyss. We can take the Demon's Door there

Kali and Surma share some domain similarities.

The cult worships [[The Three True Gods|The Three True Gods]]. They're trying to open up a connection between this plane and the abyss. 

One of Surma's jobs is to make sure the dead don't get out of where they go when they die. Surma is pretty neutral on undead. Within the Church there's a factional difference here, half the church is ok with using the undead, the other half consider undead bad.

The [[Eternal One|Eternal One]] is a Hero of [[Yethmoinen|Yethmoinen]] 

[[Vankilaan Hall]] is "near the demon's door" - cheeky revelation from Don.

Tsakor traded the Plate +1, and Phallon really digs us.



Highlights

*The party finished a good night’s rest…well, relatively good for five people being cramped in the little hut.

*Phallon was asked if he would turn over the Portable Hole magic item for the gold found. He said that while he understands the concept of party treasure, gold isn’t of much use to him. He would hope that his share could be something more useful.

*After breakfast, Gwyn used his prayer beads to make the party able to ‘cinnamon roll’ along the river and up the stream into sight of the Vankilaan Hall.

*The party landed about a quarter mile from the hall, wanting to make sure the Wight Masters defending the hall don’t attack before they know who they are.

*Upon transitioning back to solid form, Phallon rushed forward to see or meet something.

*As the party came around the corner, a mahogany stallion with diamond-shaped white birthmarks on its shoulders watched six figures in full plate in and around the teaching circle; the low-walled square training area in front of the hall. Fuzula and Ajax rested against the building watching from a distance.

*Four of them are dressed as Phallon, two sitting on the wall and two sparring with someone. Another person sits on the wall who is dressed similar to Phallon except his mail boots are red, he carries a long sword, and he wears a tunic signifying some level of authority. The sparring combatants use weapons without a sharp edge. A blow hurts but is unlikely to kill.

*The being fighting the other two in the ring wears full plate with white diamonds and a reddish-orange dot on the biceps. He wears an exquisite longsword and his breastplate is beautifully engraved with intricate symbols. With grace, power, and unmatched skill he wields a blunt greatsword with awe-inspiring expertise.

*Misquiet is 6’2” tall with glowing orange orbs in his helmet's eye slots.

*Seeing Phallon coming to the edge of the ring and the party rounding the corner, a resonating voice says “Take over for me, Red Boot.”

*As he approaches Phallon, the wight master brings his hand up as a fist before his chin. He stands at attention unmoving while the teacher looks him up and down with inspecting attention. When satisfied, the teacher thumps his left breast with his right hand saying “be at ease.” Phallon relaxes, but his excitement remains.

*Kereshi heads toward the ring and Phallon, while the rest of the party heads toward Fuzula.

*Phallon introduces Misquiet and Kereshi to each other.

*Misquiet says he is aware of who Kereshi is; including their success at Jator’s realm and how in a despicable act Kereshi’s gift was taken from him.

*Misquiet offers that if Kereshi was to worship Surma, he would be granted a gift. But a gift should not be ‘taken away’ or it wasn’t really a gift.

*Misquiet also mentions that if Kereshi were following his tenants and was to retake the top levels of the fortress under the stone tooth, he “guarantees’ warriors would come to support Kereshi and take up residence under his banner.    

*Hearing this discussion, Tsakor and Gwyn headed over to the three. Tsakor warned Kereshi, ‘You have to be careful trusting someone like this.’

*Uncomfortable with how much Misquiet knows about her and what may be asked of her in return, Kereshi said she would ‘never bow down to anyone.’

*Looking at Tsakor and Gwyn, Misquiet said, “I wonder if your opinion of me would be any different if I were to introduce you to Sutamo. I can, you know. He is on this plane and I can make it happen.”

*Gwyn said he would have an interest in such a meeting.

*Misquiet said he would have to think about it, since it seems clear that their opinion of him wouldn’t change Kereshi’s interest in Surma’s offer.

*During the conversation, Misquiet said he is an emissary and hero of Surma. He has thousands of disciples throughout many worlds that follow his philosophies and teachings, including the wight masters that protect many of Surma’s temples in his home realms.

*Also, at one point Misquiet took off his helm to set the group at ease. He appeared as a handsome strong-jawed, blonde man.

*Over the past week and a half, Fuzula has had interactions with others.

-Nuroempi isn’t seen much. He’s generally polite but somewhat sterile in his interactions.

-Ajax spends some time with her. He knows a lot about the world she comes from…much more than her about the civilized southern lands.

-The worgs don’t seem to like her much. They are not openly hostile, but clearly don’t like her presence. She thinks they may see her as a threat to their place in the hierarchy or just an interloper.

-The dire wolves just avoid her. They seem generally disinterested. She is certain that their standing in the pack may be at risk if they are friendly to her

-The tart wolves are friendly toward her. Initially a few joined Ajax near her, but Fuzula’s general likeability from animals wins them over. They don’t seem to be at risk of being kicked out of the pack due to her, and they are low enough in the pecking order to not have to worry about a little snubbing from the worgs.

-Fuzula met Misquiet that morning. She doesn’t like him much. He is arrogant and self-assured to a degree that rubs her the wrong way. He also seems to be evaluating those he interacts with almost constantly. In their first meeting, he called her “little girl.” Of course, later he called Kereshi a little girl and she is only an inch or so shorter than him.

*As the party was discussing their next move, they considered the remaining Crimson Power Stones (and other power stones) and tried to determine how much progress the cult has made by focusing their attention on it.

*As they thought about the stone “near the Demons Door,” the fact that Augustus had received one, and that Ajax had given Gwyn the impression that Augustus was his father, Fuzula decided to go talk to Ajax about the stone’s location. She learned…

               -Ajax and Augustus were paternal half-brothers, not father and son.

               -Augustus’s stone was stored at the Vankilaan Hall for a while.

               - Later, Augustus, in repayment of a bargain between Surma and Kali, delivered his stone to Kali's realm.

               -It is unclear if the stone ‘near the Demon’s Door’ is outdated information (Death Hall is near this side of the Demon’s Door) or if the stone is near the Abyss side of the Demon’s Door.

               -Ajax doesn’t think the cult is likely to have anyone capable of forcibly retrieving the stone from its resting place, certainly not anytime soon.

*There was some confusion and concern within the party. Kali is believed to be one of the “Three True Gods” worshipped by the cult. If she has the Stone of Power and they are striving to achieve her goal, then may they already have it?

*After an hour, Misquiet said tonight he would see about introducing Gwyn and Tsakor to Sutamo. He didn’t want them to get the idea he was incapable of making such a meeting happen. When he returned tonight, he would let them know when Sutamo might see them.

*Gwyn said they would wait, and he would see if they could stay at the temple another night. Misquiet said, “No worry, I’ll tell Nuroempi you’re staying another night.” Pointing at Ajax he continued, “Ajax, go get Nuroempi and tell him to come out here. I have something to tell him.”

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 2 pm on Month 7/Day 25
