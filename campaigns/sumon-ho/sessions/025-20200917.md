## Session Log

Tags: [[Letter from the Prophet]]

- Party briefly confirmed they were headed into the crevice to retrieve [[Freddie]], they would begin the assault with [[Elinor]]’s wand of entangle, and they expected it to be an assault.
- [[Bronson]] slid along the rim of the crevice keeping the high ground. This turned out to be a less effective strategy because the battle was centered under the tent and there were no ‘flanking moves’ from concealed combatants not under the tent.
- [[Fuzula Fastbritches|Fuzula]] entered the crevice and made exceptional use of her bow. She made the first surprise attack on the ritual-goers.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] and [[Elinor]] made their way around to the captives. [[Freddie]] was found among them.
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] was a very productive catalyst to the assault. Bless and guidance made turned misses into successes a few times. Sanctuary was also prudently used to protect the one they were there to save.
- [[Disciple Antwon]] on the dais was killed before his first action of the combat. Beside him on the dias within a protection circle was some food, water, and a blanket.
- The cultists/audience began turning into undead. Four were killed before their transformation. The other 7 seemed to lose their souls to the [[Stones of Power|penetration stone]], leaving behind ash-colored stains in the dirt.  
- (The DM almost fudged the rules once by cheating [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] out of the extra damage by happening to use a radiant weapon on a vulnerable undead; but wouldn’t do it.)
- The [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]] threw it over the melded stone.
- [[Disciple Antwon|Antwon]]’s leather armor is magical. He also had a letter that talked about the will of the 3 true gods, the rough location of 6 more [[Stones of Power]], an estate in [[Aimesville]], and there would be a benefit to creating 3 Binding Sites if powered by at least 30 souls. The letter was signed by [[The Prophet]].  
- [[Freddie]]’s benefactor is [[Hun-Hoksa]], protector of the Sumon Ho region. After the letter was read out loud, [[Freddie]] had said that he had to make his way to [[Aimesville]].
- The ‘human traders’ that captured [[Freddie]] and the 2 townspeople were the same ones who tried to kidnap [[Elinor]]. But they were not part of the ritual.
- The melded stone seems unmovable.
- [[Danger Inc.|Danger Incorporated]] made the site appear as if the ritual never happened. Taking the tent down, they burned it and the bodies. The stone was covered with dirt.
- They are now looking at delivering the [[Necomancers Bane]] to the [[🗺️ Dancing Drakes Inn]] inn, then either going to [[Aimesville]] to secure a [[Stones of Power|penetration stone]] before the acquisition team can or going to kidnap [[Yusdrayl|Yusdrayl]].
- The team drug their butts back to [[Blessingburg]] a couple hours before sun up.


>[!quote] The Letter found on [[Disciple Antwon]]
>Dear [[Disciple Antwon]],
>
>I greatly appreciate your successful evocation of the 1st [[Binding Site]]. This accomplishment gives us a great start to piercing the veil between our world and the restless place of the forsaken souls of the people. It is the will of the 3 true gods to return these souls to their eternal right to inhabit this land. You have clearly set yourself apart as one of the bravest and most creative of our Brotherhood. You have clearly demonstrated your ingenuity and I am forever grateful.
>
>After establishing the 2nd [[Binding Site]], you shall meet with the acquisition team in [[Aimesville]] at the normal place. They are to acquire a [[Stones of Power|Stones of Power]] from the cellar of the [[Everson Estate]] locally. The owner is not expected to be cooperative. When they have it, they should deliver it to [[Disciple Kenton]].
>
>There are also 2 [[Stones of Power]] to be acquired in the [[Ravaged Lands]]. They are in the possession of the shaman of the Tear Bringer orc tribe and the master of the [[Passion Place]]. Delivery instructions for these stones will be given to the team upon delivery of the [[Aimesville]] stone.
>
>There are three other [[Stones of Power]] they should prepare to conquest. They are near the Demon’s Door so they will be extremely dangerous missions. But make them aware that this will be their responsibility when the time comes.
>
>I personally thank you for your service. It will be an amazing accomplishment to have 2 binding sites established. A third may allow some benefit if it can be created with the power of at least 30 souls. And you’re contribution has been of great worth. I’m sure The Three will reward you beyond what even I can offer. 
>
>Eternally,
>[[The Prophet]]
