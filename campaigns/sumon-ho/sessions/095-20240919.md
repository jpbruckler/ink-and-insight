Recap on the caper so far:

- we believe [[Pharr|Chief Sgt Pharr]], brother-in-law of [[Lord Cummings]], was responsible for hiring the people 
- [[Fuzula]] tracked [[Fronda]] as she ([[Fronda]]) left the [[Marred Cask]]
- [[Enyo]], [[Fuzula]], and [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went to go talk to [[Fronda]] and were able to get some information about [[Lyriena]], a master thief, who currently has possession of the [[Delerium]]
	- [[Lyriena]] is where the phrase "Lyriena slide" originated



### On [[Olseris]] and Gwynn...

Gwyn has a desire to get to the [[SLD]] Tower ([[Trent's Keep]]), where **the** [[Sage of Life and Death]] is. A joke was made about perhaps Gwyn taking up with [[Averos]]' security detail... one that [[Averos]] was fine with.

### We Begin....

- The magic broker [[Erabis]] comes in to the [[üó∫Ô∏è Lavish Pumpkin]] looking for Gwyn, he has a seller that would part with one for 2100, where 1800 is more a marketable range. Gwyn takes the offer, as he is leaving with [[Averos]] that day. Erabis will have them in hand in 3 to 4 days, and [[Gwyn]] will reach out to him via Sending in several days.
- [[Erabis]] offers a spellbook to [[Enyo]] for 1200gp, + 75gp for an Identify spell, needed to read the spells in the book
	- 12 spells, including 2 of 3rd level
- [[Olseris]] and [[Telliva]] head for a couple of the taverns near the guard, with the intention of finding some more information on Chief Inspector Pharr. 
	- Performance check of 13 (womp womp)
	- Investigation of 16
	- Generally get the feeling that there's not really much corruption, and that they mostly feel like they have the opportunity to report anything they see without fear of repercussion.
- Took us a few hours, [[Telliva]] and I return to the [[üó∫Ô∏è Lavish Pumpkin]] around 4 or 5 pm
- Upon return, Fuzula goes off to case the warehouse
	- 5 guards 

### The Break-In

- We make our ways seperately to an abandoned building near [[Lyriena]]'s hideout. Enyo and Olseris cast invisibility on the party and make their way into the building through a secret door that Fuzula spied during the stake-out
- The first room has crates full of gems of varying qualities. Olseris notices that the middle of the floor is cleaner than the rest of the floor.
- Fuzula determines it's a trap and disarms it
- Kereshi and and I listen at the 2 doors
	- I hear "Ah HAHA! Got ya there!"
	- Kereshi hears what sounds like footsteps heading towards the door
- The door Kereshi was listening at opens, and a guard comes through the door. He enters the room, looks around, stops and sniffs the air, muttering something about smelling sweet (he passed Fuzula), then turns and walks within a couple of inches of me
- The next room has 4 shelves with various thingamajigs on them, and barrels full of rolled up parchment
- I listen at the door and hear footsteps moving away. I open the door a crack to try to look in, with a 28 stealth.
- Then I hear being unlocked, opened, and it being closed again.
- I let the party know it's clear, then make my way through the door
- The next room has 2 doors, one straight in front of me that I'm fairly certain the person went through, and one to the right.
	- In this room there are 2 large Iron Safes.
	- Enyo states emphatically that these are document safes
- Listening at the door, I hear whistling in the next room, behind the locked door I'm listening at.
- Kereshi hears nothing behind her door, and opens it a crack, seeing a gallery/trophy room.
	- Landscape paintings on the wall
		- 4 12' wite paintings
		- 1 2' wide painting
	- 2 statues in the middle of the room, male and female, holding musical instruments
		- When Kereshi opened the door, the statue facing the door spewed fire at the door; Kereshi takes 16 points of damage and Fuzula gets hit while she's trying to pick the lock.
- Fuzula unlocks the door, which leads to the front room/foyer of the building. A guard stands in the middle of the room, whistling.
- Fuzula sneaks past the guard into the next room - the guard's breakroom.
- We all go through the door into the statue room. Failed the Dex save, 33hp damage

Session 95 (9/19/2024): Looking for a vault within the vault

Highlights

* Aribis Psicon, the magic item broker, came to the lavish pumpkin.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† -He told Gwyn he had found an Immovable Rod. The seller would have to travel many days over rough and rugged land. He wouldn‚Äôt part with it and make the trip for less than 2,100 gp, although Aribis advises that the item itself is worth more like 1,800 gp. Gwyn paid for the item. He was leaving today, so he would use a Sending spell to make arrangements for delivery.

-Aribis hasn‚Äôt made progress on finding a group of Sending Stones, but he can exchange a set of 2 for 450 gp. Kereshi paid for the Sending Stones, which should be delivered in about a week.

-The adult children of a deceased mage are selling his spell book. It appraises for 1,700 gp, but they are selling it for 1,500 gp if it sells quickly. Since Enyo is present and has the funds, he offered it to her. She bought it. He also will provide one spell scroll of Identify for 75 gp; needed for her to read the other mages spell book. It will take some time to copy the spells to Enyo‚Äôs spell book so she can use them.¬†

*Olseris and Gwyn made final plans for Gwyn to go with Averos. Gwyn left the Scepter of Eternal Winter with the party; namely Olseris. He also gave Olseris his extra Breastplate +1 for adventuring.

*Olseris and Telliva headed to bars and taverns frequented by members of the guard to see if Olseris could learn anything about corrupt officials (Farr). The guards seemed to generally trust their leaders and no significant information was learned.

*Fuzula did reconnaissance of Lyriena‚Äôs vault. She learned a bit about the guard positions, rotations, and shift changes from a vacant building and the lumberyard. As she headed down the road to leave, she saw a secret door in the building.

*After some brief planning, they left for the building around midnight.

*The traveled separately but met up at the vacant house near Lyriena‚Äôs vault.

*Once there, Fuzula cast Pass Without Trace, then both Olseris and Enyo cast invisibility at 3rd level. Each party member was covered by both spells.

*Fuzula and Olseris headed for the secret door. They found it to open without issue. Kereshi and Enyo were not long behind them.

*They were in a gem room. Olseris noticed a trap in the middle of the floor, but Fuzula was able to disable it with her tools.

*Fuzula implored Kereshi not to touch anything (or take anything). They wanted to get the delerium and get out as if they were never there.

*Two doors exited the room. One sounded like it had 2 people horsing around in it. The other door sounded like someone was walking toward them. Still invisible, Olseris pushed against the wall between the two doors and the others hid out of the way in case the person headed toward the gems.

*A guard passed within inches of Olseris moving between doors while on patrol.

*The party moved into the next room, which had 4 shelves with glass vials of liquid and several barrels with parchment.

*They heard someone walking away from them in the next room.

*After he left, locking the door behind him, they moved into the next room. It held 2 safes that Enyo knew were used to store documents.

*A door headed to the south and one to the west. They listened at each door. While Fuzula picked the lock of the south door, Kereshi entered the unlocked room to the west.

*A flash of flames from a statue‚Äôs trumpet flashed Kereshi and singed Fuzula behind him.

*Both Kereshi and Fuzula continued on their scouting missions.

*Fuzula silently opened the door, seeing the roving guard in the lobby. Looping around, she learned the two men horsing around were off duty guards playing cards in the break room.

*After checking out the statue in the lobby, Fuzula headed back to the group in the room with the safes.

*Keresh found herself in a gallery that had 4 large paintings and a small one. Two musician statues were facing the 2 doors.

*Kereshi crossed the large room to the other door. Being careful not to step in front of the door or be in front of the door when it opened (any more than necessary), she tried the door. No trap went off, but seeing three suits of armor in the next room she shut the door.

*Kereshi joined the rest of the group in the room with the document safes. She and Fuzula got back at about the same time.

*The party moved into the gallery, trying to avoid the trap. The last one to enter was Olseris, but the trap must have been larger than he thought. It was set off again.

*Fuzula suggested Enyo check the large paintings to see if any of them hid secret doors. She found that the one on the far wall did. The painting on the west wall pivots, along with a bookshelf in the next room.

*Approximately 15 minutes remain on the pass without trace and invisibility spells that are concealing the party members.¬†
