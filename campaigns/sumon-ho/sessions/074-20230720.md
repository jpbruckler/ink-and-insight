Last session: [[073-20230622]]

Session started with me talking to the group 

[[Northern Invasion]] was 50 years before now. 

Reputation of [[The Darkhouse]] is, [[Sutamo]] is known to the public largely as the patron of thieves and thugs. [[Sutamo]] is a god in waiting. We oppose oppression and support the right to not be oppressed. We are often at odds with the establishment.

The [[Putrid Lake]] is beyond the [[Demons Door]]. We can acquire a map in [[🗺️ Nuthornville]].


Fuzula asked about my past a little bit. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] comes clean about his past.

The Party votes and agrees to bring Tsakor along. We meet in the common room in the morning. 

[[Freddie]] says there's a map in [[🗺️ Nuthornville]], owned by Lt. Michael Winters. One of the City Guard, and a son of a Bureacrat. 
[[Estari Malcolm]] is a Deacon in the local church, and a friend of Lt. Winters. [[Freddie]] gives us some information that identifies us as members of the [[Mountain Sanctum|Order of the Tranquil Sky]]. The order has a relationship with [[Estari Malcolm|Estari]], and we can use the identification to compel [[Estari Malcolm|Estari]] to help us.

We finish breakfast, and cinnamon roll out. About halfway we run into a thunderstorm. We drop down below the clouds, when we sense danger. We're struck by lightning, and notice swirling air in the clouds above us (sense more than see a very large swirling)

We take 51 points of damage, unless we make our save.
- Fuzula and Gwynn did not make their save (DEX)
- [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]], [[Enyo]], and Tsakor do make their save

Roll initiative - 

The party decides to run away. The swirling shape comes down out of the cloud a bit, senses that we're dashing away, then moves back into the cloud.

About an hour after the thunderstorm, we see a large group of wolves, a dozen or 2. We see them dashing after something, several sheep running towards a shack, and we see a boy doing his best to usher the sheep in and out of trouble as best he could. 

The wolves are tearing apart the sheep that didn't make it, then start trying to get into the shack. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] heads down behind the wolves, Tsakor and the party join him.

We kill all but 2 of the wolves, who run away. We walk the kid back to the farm, and I give him 6 GP to help cover the cost of the sheep.

We make it to [[🗺️ Nuthornville]], and come out of the Wind Walk. The town guard ask us what we're there for, but Tsakor steps up and identifies himself as a Lord (DotMM) .

Everyone except [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] set out looking for [[Estari Malcolm]]

(investigation checks - Fuzula 19, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] 9)

We find [[Estari Malcolm|Estari]]'s home in 4 story build in a lower middle-class neighborhood. We head towards the building, and notice the grass isn't taken care of very well. There's leaves and grass have been laying there for months (unkempt). The air is dry and smells faintly of burnt coal.

I knock on the 3rd floor door of [[Estari Malcolm|Estari's]] apartment. It's painted blue with red swirls. The door is opened by a meek woman, she looks out the windows and her eyes go wide before she opens the door, asking us in.

We find [[Estari Malcolm]] has been taken for ransom.

A small girl knocks on the door, she was sent to give a note to [[Gwyn Hovey|Sigmund]]. The rest of [[TheSermountParty]] will follow behind, sneaking.

Note received 2 days ago
Kidnappers took [[Estari Malcolm|Estari]] and are planning to offer him to "the lady" - see Don's email for more info

Session 74 (7/20/2023): The [[Estari Malcolm|Malcolms’]] predicament

Highlights

- After a discussion about [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]]’s background, the party voted to have Tsakor join them for the trip to the Putrid Lake.
- In the morning, Fuzula, [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]].
- [[Freddie]] said the map is in the collection of a man named Michael Winters. He is a Lieutenant in the city guard, although he is also the son of a wealthy bureaucrat. In his estate, he has a collection of maps and diaries from ages past. The only map [[Freddie]] has heard reference Putrid Lake is in his collection. [[Freddie]] says, “While I don’t know how receptive Lt. Winters would be to your showing up, a friend knows him well. A man by the name of [[Estari Malcolm]] has known him for many years and is a Deacon at his church. [[Estari Malcolm|Estari]] is an ally of our order. I can give you a note that states you are from the [[Mountain Sanctum|Order of the Tranquil Sky]].” [[Freddie]] hopes [[Estari Malcolm|Estari]] can help the party gain access to the map.
- Flying high in the sky from [[Aimesville]] to [[🗺️ Nuthornville]], the party was zapped by lightning from dark storm clouds with devastating effects on both the landscape below and the party’s health. The threat seemed to be a huge-sized body of whirling air among the clouds.
- With their limited ability to fight in wind travel form, the party dashed away.
- About an hour from [[🗺️ Nuthornville]], they saw a large group of wolves below, 4 dire wolves and 12 wolves. It is a truly menacing site, one that could overrun many small towns. They seem to be dashing after something. As you scan the direction they are running, you first spot a few sheep and a small shack. A few moments later you realize that a small lad, maybe 10 or 12 years old, is trying to get the sheep into the shack. Several have made it inside and a few more are on the way, but the wolves are closing fast. Although not all of the sheep are in, the boy slams the door behind him. While many a shepherd has died protecting his flock, the terror of so many wolves made the young boy try to save what he could.
- Out the small window opening, the boy watches as the wolves tear apart much of the flock. However, the wolves are not satiated. A few are already swarming the shed trying to find a way in. With the shutter closed over the window opening now, they haven’t found a way in. But you fear it is only a matter of time.  
- The party dove down to help the child. They killed most of the threat and helped the boy return home safely with the few sheep remaining. [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] gave him some gold, 5 for his family losing their sheep and 1 for the boy.
- Once the group could convert back to vapor form, they began traveling again.
- Landing a 30-60 minute walk from the city gate, they reverted to solid form and headed toward the gate.
- Tsakor used some credentials as a “Lord” of a ‘far off land’ to stave off spending too much time answering questions on their business. It was unclear to the party whether the credentials were real or a forgery, but no one in the party had heard of the place.
- While most of the party headed to find [[Kereshi Khill|Kereshi]] went her own way for the time being.  
- [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] and Fuzula led the party to the right apartment in a lower middle class neighborhood on the eastern side of the city.
- Each apartment has a wide window although [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn]] knocks on the door, made of solid material and painted blue with red swirls. Hearing movement inside you see a female face poke out the curtain. She pales at the sight of you, but moves quickly to the door. Although you are expecting the door to open slightly, the woman in a nice dress, modest but well cared for, swings the door open wide and steps aside. Her puffy eyes stare at the floor while she quietly says, “Won’t you come in.”
- The room behind the door is comfortable but sparse. Clearly a few paintings used to hang on the wall, although they are leaning against the chair and small couch now. You do see through a doorway into the kitchen and eating room, several valuables set on the table. While not expensive, the vases, dishes, and a few jewelry items sit out as if on display. The party files into the apartment to conduct their business in private, but before the door is quite shut the lady bursts out, “I don’t have the money. I’m trying, but I don’t have it. We are simple people, and five hundred gold pieces are beyond my means. Please don’t hurt him, just give me some time.”
- They explained to [[Monica Malcolm]] that they were not here to hurt her even though they may seem intimidating. She was even more distraught to find out that they were not the kidnappers of her husband, since she was not allowed to tell anyone.
- The note she received 2 days ago reads as follows.

> [[Monica Malcolm|Mrs. Malcolm]]. We have taken possession of your husband. He will have the honor of being sacrificed to our divine Lady. While you should be joyful for his good fortune, we understand that this may cause a gleeful but burdensome future for you. Therefore, in 2 days we will provide instructions on how you can make a 500 gp donation in exchange for your husband’s freedom. Do not tell any others of your situation. We will be watching. If you tell anyone, we will immediately go forward with the sacrifice.|

- A note was delivered by a young girl (7 years old or so). It said Monica was to meet them in one hour in a particular alley if she wanted to ‘donate’ the money for her husband’s return.
- The party said they would utilize their own 500 gp, and get her husband back.
- There were ideas between Gwyn going unarmored and unarmed with the party to pounce when the time is right, to letting [[Monica Malcolm|Mrs. Malcolm]] take the money so she didn’t tell anyone. The plan’s details need to be worked out, but it definitely involves stealth and getting their 500 gp back.
- Tsakor casts Cure Light Wounds on Gwyn (14 hp added). He casts a second Cure Light Wounds (9 hp added). While both Fuzuala and Gwyn would benefit, he decided to cast it on Gwyn since one option discussed is for Gwyn to go unarmored for the exchange.
- The party begins a short rest. Party members who don’t do anything strenuous between now and the exchange will benefit from the short rest.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 7 pm on Month 7/Day 15
