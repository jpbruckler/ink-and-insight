Next morning after the meeting with Alexander, we pick up at the Lavish Pumpkin.

Captain Winters is in the dining room when Kereshi, Enyo and Fuzula come down. He invites them to breakfast, where he speaks a bit about his upbringing and past as a merchant.

A guard appears with information about a murder.

The guard said that:

>A half orc brute was ambushed. His assailant was hurt in the attack. As the assailant tried to get away, he succumbed to his wounds. The half orc also died from his wounds.

>The murder scene is at "The Lively Wench"

>The guard meant that the "acquaintance of Telliva" was the half-orc that looks like Tsakor.

As we arrive at the scene, it's clear that the half orc is indeed [[Rhag]]. The assailant was a human, in fine clothes and stiff boots. 

Unfortunately, we don't have enough of a description of the other crew to determine if the assailant was with them.

Fuzula suggests we get the parrots from the previous murder scene, an actually ingenious idea.

Kereshi takes a look around and was able to fairly confidently determine that the "assailant" and Rhag were walking together when they were attacked.

The blood coming out the human's nose, according to Enyo, was likely due to psychic damage (arcana check at 17).

I bring the human back as a rock gnome (effectively ruining Fuzula's plan) using the Sceptre of Eternal winter (Reincarnate)

The rock gnome (Marco) says a guy just appeared in the middle of the street saying all kinds of scary things, and he tried to run away, but he was caught and was murdered.

Enyo gets the impression that the actual attacker was invisible and lost invisibility casting fear or whatever. 

Marco tells us he lives with 6 other folks in a small house. Fuzula and Kereshi head to the small house out of concern for the rest of the occupants.

They find out that Marco is the one that arranged the jobs.

----

Rhag is alive and describes the scene. 4 assailants. He does slip and say that the people that attacked them were 

Marco was hired by a guy that had a woman with him. Marco met with the guy, and 

The human was the Chief Investigator for the guard. Fronda.

I spill the beans to the Captain about the meet, what Rhag and Marco were doing.

Captain Winters said that he would have a hard time getting a sting together, so I offer the services of our party.

---

Fuzula and the rest of the party meet Marco and give him 20gp and send him to the Lavish Pumpkin and tell him to lay low.

---


Marco says that he was supposed to get the note from the bartender.

We make a plan to disguise self Kereshi as what Marco used to look like and spread the word that he was brought back to life.

Telliva mentions that there is a gang house, called the Marred Cask and Tasty Mead tavern.

Session 92 (8/22/2024): Death does not prevent interviews

Highlights

*After a good night’s sleep, Kereshi, Fuzula, and Enyo came down the stairs to find Captain Winters just arriving. Gwyn arrived shortly after, while Tsakor remained in his room.

*While eating breakfast with him, a runner from the guard approached the tables with news.

*   “Captain, Director Vance sends word.” She pauses as she looks at the motley bunch seated with the Captain.

   Winters says, “Go ahead, I’ll stop you if the topic gets too sensitive.”

   “Very well, Captain. The details of a murder were reported to the Director early this morning. One of the dead, there were 2, but one may have been an acquaintance of Telliva the Rauha Minor.” She pauses in case she is to stop; then continues. “The Director sent 2 of us to find you and let you know that you may want to visit the scene a few blocks north of the Lively Wench. He didn’t say why, presumably you know. And if I may, it sounded like I was to relay information, not that the Director was directing you to go.”

   “What happened?” asked the Captain.

   The guard said, “It looks as if a half-orc brute was ambushed. His assailant was hurt in the attack. When he tried to escape to the roof, he fell. Between the stabs and the fall, he succumbed to his wounds.”

*The party decided to visit the site. While it would be a public display of their relationship with Captain Winters and possibly this investigation, they wanted to see if the body appeared to be the member of the ‘noise crew’ that looked like Tsakor. It was deemed best to do this at the scene.

*As you approach, you can see the body of a half-orc in trousers and a large black cloak sprawled on the ground face first; a short sword beside him. A couple of guardsmen approach to bar your passage, but Captain Winters motions to let you through. Two investigators are examining the body without touching it while another guard draws the scene.

   The half-orc lays in the street. Two deep gashes appear in his back. His right arm lays above his head and his left is beside his body. His short sleeve shirt shows a forearm tattoo of a black battle axe from the crook of his elbow to mid forearm. An inked cord went from the handle and wrapped around the bottom of his bicep in red and grey. He lays in the street near the sidewalk, apparently facing the alley at the time of his death. Another body lays face up in the alley.

   A human lays flat on his back with a blank stare skyward as dried blood below his nose. Wearing well-fitting clothing and stiff boots, he has a single piercing wound in his chest. However, there is also clear evidence of his head hitting the ground where he lies. 

*Fuzula ran to get the parrot to see if the ‘assailant’ was recognized as one of the people who broke into the research assistance’s house to torture her for information. She cast Longstrider, rushed to the house, gained entrance with her handy lock picking tools, grabbed the bird, locked the door on the way out with her handy tools, and showed up back at the alley with the bird to see if it would recognize the assailant. But…

*Kereshi, using a lifetime of experience tracking and surviving in the wilderness, believed she isolated 4 or 5 sets of footprints involved in the ambush on the soggy road, not just the two belonging to the bodies.

*While one of the 2 investigators was interested but skeptical, the party “saved him from himself” and Kereshi showed him what she found. He was still a little skeptical it wasn’t just traffic, but the other investigator was impressed.

*Kereshi also found that it appeared the “assailant” was ‘hoisted and dropped’ instead of ‘climbed and fell.’

*Gwyn, using the immense power of his faith, could restore life to Rhag with a Raise Dead spell. He also decided to use the Scepter of Eternal Winter to reincarnate the other body.

*Captain Winters told Gwyn to wait until the site investigation was complete before moving bodies.

*Since Raise Dead takes an hour to cast, Gwyn began with reincarnating the human body; Marco.

*After reincarnation, Marco was in a rock gnome body.

*One of the investigators and the party asked Marco a few questions.

*After speaking to Marco, and later Rhag, the ambush went something like this…

- The ambush started when someone backstabbed Rhag; followed immediately by a spell caster casting a painful spell on Marco forcing him to run away into the alley. A “crazy guy” rushed up behind Rhag to soften him up. Rhag found it hard to lift his arms as he fought.

-While a lady rogue and the spellcaster finished off Rhag, the crazy, fast guy closed with Marco. Both of them thought the half-elven rogue was with the guy who hired Marco to be the second crew in the crimes.

-After the pugilist and Marco exchanged a few blows, Marco dropped to the ground asleep as if by a spell.

-Marco had a brief moment of weightless consciousness, before feeling his spirit jarred from his body. 

*Upon arriving with the parrot, Fuzula found that Marco was now a rock gnome and the bird would have no chance of identifying him. However, given Marco’s story supported by Kereshi’s assessment, the bird would not have recognized him as an intruder in the torture and murder of Ella Ravensmoore.

*Fearing the entire crew is at risk due to the main crew “tying up loose ends,” Fuzula and Kereshi headed to Marco’s house where he and Rhag lived with 5 other people.

*Marco was taken back to the local guard office for questioning; questioning as a victim rather than an assailant. Telliva went with them as a precaution in case the ‘mole’ was there and might try to finish off the job of killing Marco.

*After Gwyn brought Rhag back from the dead, he was also asked some questions by the investigators and party. During which he made a comment that the attacker looked like she might be the girl who hired Marco. Later, he claimed to have no idea what he was talking about in those moments right after being raised…Marco has worked a lot of odd jobs, like as a day laborer, just like Rhag.

*Gwyn and Rhag feigned dizziness, while Capt Winters told the investigator he could keep going to work on his report; Winters and his accompanying guards would see to it Rhag got back to the office.

*Rhag also said about the man who hired the crew…

-“While Marco met with him, me and Jina hid in the darkness. They wanted him to meet alone, but Marco wanted backup. So we saw the meeting go down. There were two of them, a human and a female half-elf with heavy makeup. I’m not sure who the girl was, but I know who the human was. He tried to wear a disguise, but it was a bad one. I could tell, besides I know his voice. It was the Chief Investigator for the guard. After Marco left, he called the girl Fronda. But I don’t know her. Under her hood, I could see a spot of blonde hair above her eye.”

-When Gwyn shared this with Capt Winters on the way back to the local guard office, he asked, “Are you sure it was the Chief Investigator? How certain are you?”

-Rhag responded, “I’d know that twerp anywhere. He has chased us a few times. He’s never caught me, but he has nabbed Marco before. But I’ve had a real good look at him. And his disguise was terrible. It was him, I’m almost certain.”

*With this information, Winters asked Gwyn to focus on the girl while he tried to decide what he could do with this information; what he could confirm and what he could act on. Not only is the Chief Investigator a senior member of the guard (although not a long tenured one), he also has political connections. In fact, he is the brother-in-law of Lord Aster Cummings.

*At Marco’s house, Fuzula found Jina and 2 men. Fuzula’s stealthy natural character made her relatable to Jina, who let her in.

-Jina saw the two people who hired Marco and his crew. Jina has seen her before. Her name is something like Ronda. She hangs out in Swivel Lane and has a blonde streak in her dark hair.

-Jina and one of the men in the room, Labby, are the other two members who worked the job.

-Kereshi and Fuzula implored them to stay in the house, better yet to go somewhere else entirely to hide out. If they don’t, they will surely die. Fuzula said ‘Marco and Rhag kind of died, but they are back so it is OK.’

-The two were given 25 gp each to fund their hiding out.

-Jina mentioned they were supposed to be paid tonight. Marco is the only one that is allowed to meet the guy who hired them.

*At that, Kereshi and Fuzula headed back to the alley where the attack happened. Enyo was waiting there and led them toward the guard office.

*As they reached the city guard office for a few more questions, Marco was leaving.

*They stopped Marco on his way home and diverted him to the Lavish Pumpkin Inn. They gave him 20 gp as well.

*After his interview, the party escorted Rhag to the Lavish Pumpkin. After making sure they made it into a room, the party (including Telliva) convened in one of the conference rooms.

*Since Marco was supposed to pick up a slip of paper from the bartender at the Lively Wench at 6 pm tonight to find out where to go to be paid, the party considered their options for using this information. 

-No one expects that the Chief Inspector or main crew is going to pay this crew, as they killed the man they were supposed to pay.

-But they talked about options like spreading word that Marco had been reincarnated as a half-orc and letting Kereshi pretend to be him with the hope of being ambushed.

*During the discussion, Telliva went to see if his trusted resources have any intelligence on a criminal named Rhonda in the Swivel Lane area.

*Telliva returned a couple hours later with word.

-There is a Rhonda that spends a lot of her time at the “Marred Cask and Tasty Mead” tavern. This is closer to a den of malignancy than a functioning, profitable business.

-She is a con artist and charlatan that does some second-story work.

-When not hiding it, she is known to have a blonde streak of hair starting over her left eye.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 2 pm on Month 7/Day 30
