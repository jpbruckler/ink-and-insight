## Session Log

- Fuzula is in jail, [[Kereshi Khill]] and I are at the Inn ([[üó∫Ô∏è Lavish Pumpkin]], while the rest of
  the party left to give their statements.
- We hear a knock at the door, they identify themselves as a Roha
  - She is a gnome
  - There is also a peacekeeper and a double sashed sienna
  - And a bunch of other people bristling with bows and weapons
  - The officer that comes in asks if [[Kereshi Khill]] will go quietly, and put on anti-magic cuffs
  - The Rohas officer asks me if I'm [[Kereshi Khill]]'s father, to which I reply "Spiritual"
  - I walk with them as they guide [[Kereshi Khill]] to the Station
  - The 2 Sienna and the Peacekeeper break from the 4 Roha and the 5 city guard, who are taking
    [[Kereshi Khill]] back to the station
  - The elf that came into the room keeps some minor conversation up with me as we walk.
  - [[Kereshi Khill]] is able to summon her Echo manifestation even shackled, but she dismisses it
- [[Kereshi Khill]] cooperates during the interrogation, and is "put up for the evening"
- The investigator comes to tell me that "Regina" is being held over to see the magistrate in the
  morning. He also asked if I'd be willing to give a statement, to which I agreed.
- [[Tsakor]] went to Fellwig's office, then back to the Lavish Pumpkin.
- [[Enyo]] is also at the Lavish Pumpkin
- After my statement, I return to the Lavish Pumpkin
- [[Enyo]], [[Tsakor]] and I all go to the courthouse the next morning.
  - [[Tsakor]] stays outside, armored and armed.
  - I go in "street clothes" with the holy symbol of [[Diancecht]] prominantly displayed
  - [[Enyo]] also comes to proceedings in street clothes
  - The judge looks like an owl, eyes too large for his head, or too small a nose, with feathered
    hair
  - The "prosecutor" is trying to be fair. The legal system of [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]] is not one of
    competition, there is a focus on facts
    - He brings up the kidnapping, and points out that Fuzula was trying to free [[Estari Malcolm]]
    - He also admits to there being agents of Kipyanti involved
    - He said the it was unclear if Eric, the deceased, were involved with Kipyanti, or if there
      were some ties between Fuzula and the dead man that led to the "murder"
    - [[Estari Malcolm]]'s drawings of the kidnappers didn't include the deceased
    - He also says there's nothing keeping her in town
  - Fuzula objects to the idea that it took a long time for her to shoot 4 arrows and offers to show
    them

    After Fuzula's proceedings, "Regina" is brought forward
  - The prosecutor explains that he believes Regina should be kept for additional investigation.
    While it's true that the guy we beat up was found to be guilty. The prosecutor isn't arguing
    that the assault be charged, in this case, the issue is her escape from prison. He's asking that
    Regina be held over a couple of days.
  - I testify on [[Kereshi Khill]]'s behalf.
  - After I do, a man Rumford Kipling, a man of Lord Cumming's service. He offers a letter from the
    Lord testifying to the character of "Kerishi Khill". The magistrate asks about the name issue,
    and Rumford indicates that Lord Cummings

- [[Kereshi Khill]] wants to sell some things
- [[Enyo]] and [[Tsakor]] go sightseeing.

Session 76 (8/17/2023):Trial by fire

Highlights

\*The [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]] Guard requested [[50 TTRPG/51 Settings/Scalinea/Aimesland]] [[Rauha]] to apprehend Regina Phalange. Kereshi, and Gwyn,
went with the [[Rauha]] peacefully.

\*‚ÄôRegina‚Äô was interviewed about the man she pummeled and about escaping from jail. Gwyn also shared
his thoughts with the [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]] Guard. They both somewhat downplayed Kereshi‚Äôs escape as driven
by her age/youth and a fear of authority from her upbringing.

\*Fuzula and ‚ÄòRegina‚Äô were both set for legal proceedings in the morning.

\*In the morning, the kidnapper who was captured by the party had his proceedings. Evidence of guilt
was sufficient to hold him for a formal trial. The magistrate ruled that he was complicit in the
kidnapping of Istari [[Malcolm]]. Among the evidence, Istari one of the portraits that Istari had drawn
of his attacker appeared to be this man.

\*[[Enyo]] and Gwyn attended the proceedings held for Fuzula and ‚ÄòRegina.‚Äô Tsakor waited outside of the
court building with his equipment.

\*The prosecutor argued to keep Fuzula in custody until there was more evidence she was not guilty
of murdering Erik on the rooftop. The prosecutor was most concerned that Fuzula would leave
[[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]] immediately upon being set free and impossible to apprehend again. Erik‚Äôs mother gave
an emotional plea on his behalf, stating that she didn‚Äôt know why he was on the rooftop but he was
not involved in anything illegal. Istari spoke on Fuzula‚Äôs behalf, but had to admit that he couldn‚Äôt
be certain that Erik fired the crossbow bolt at him, only that it came from the area he was later
shot at. Gwyn spoke to Fuzula‚Äôs character.

\*After deliberating for only 15 minutes or so, the magistrate comes out, takes his seat, and asks
Fuzula to stand. He says, ‚ÄúWhile it is very unusual for a magistrate to close a case in a murder
proceedings, I am inclined to do so. While I feel for the mother of the killed man, I have heard no
evidence that suggests he was not involved in the criminal activity perpetrated against Mr. Malcolm.
He was also facing the defendant for every arrow that struck him. [[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]] does not condone
vigilante justice or murderous revenge, but the evidence suggests the defendant was providing
support for trying to exchange gold for Mr. Malcolm‚Äôs life. While I‚Äôm not sure what went wrong in
the exchange, given the circumstances it is reasonable to think that the defendant considered
herself in danger and may have believed she couldn‚Äôt easily escape without defending herself. While
these proceedings will be recorded, it will be noted that no guilt was found of the defendant. If
something like this were to happen again, it should be advanced to a higher judge even if no guilt
is readily found. [[Fuzula Fastbritches]] you are free to go.‚Äú

\*The prosecutor did not make any argument against ‚ÄòRegina‚Äô related to pummeling the ‚Äúsuspected
kidnapper.‚Äù However, she did escape from jail and there were still questions about why, as well as
her violent streak. Other related crimes may not have been discovered. Gwyn spoke on her behalf and
shared that she was involved in important work.

\*Rumford Kipling, manservant to [[Lord Aster Cummings]], says, ‚ÄúI have for your inspection a letter
from my Lord relating to the character of the defendant. Beyond his business success, Lord Cummings
is a member of the merchants‚Äô guild‚Äôs Steering Council and a respected member of our beloved
[[üó∫Ô∏è Nuthornville]].‚Äù The magistrate acknowledges being familiar with Lord Cummings.

Rumford continues, ‚ÄúWhile he cannot speak to the innocence of [[Kereshi Khill]], he is aware of her
character. She may be quick-tempered and rash sometimes. She can even be petulant at times, not
unusual for someone her age. But the group that she travels with have dedicated themselves to
helping the people of [[50 TTRPG/51 Settings/Scalinea/Aimesland]]. For example, [[Vivian Powell]] of [[Fowlerville]] was very appreciative of
Kereshi‚Äôs efforts in recovering the remains of her children from goblins in league with an evil
druid. It is important, if determined appropriate by your wisdom, Kereshi and her companions return
to their work.‚Äù

The magistrate motions Rumford forward. The [[Blazing Shields|Blazing Shield]] on duty in the room takes a leather
scroll case from him and delivers it to the magistrate. Opening the case and breaking the seal on
the letter, he reads it slowly seeming to consider each word.

The magistrate says, ‚ÄúYou refer to her as [[Kereshi Khill]]. The defendant is identified as Regina
Phalange. Are you sure you‚Äôre at the right trial?‚Äù

Rumford looks unsteady for a moment, then says ‚ÄúI am positive the defendant is the one Lord Cummings
wrote about. He calls her Kereshi, despite her name being Regina.‚Äù

The magistrate says, ‚ÄúThank you Rumford. And thank Lord Cummings for his time in this matter.‚Äù
Looking around he says, ‚ÄúAny others?‚Äù With no others stepping forward to add to the proceedings, he
says ‚ÄúI will consider the evidence and share my findings then.‚Äù He stands and moves out the door
behind him.

\*The magistrate says, ‚ÄúRegina, please stand. Given the outcome of your companion‚Äôs proceedings,
weighing the evidence, and weighing the statements of the respected Lord Cummings, I declare that
your misadventures will be documented in the legal record under both your name and your alias,
Kereshi. Furthermore, an 80 gp fine will be levied to reimburse the city‚Äôs cost in apprehending you
after your escape. I cannot emphasize enough that childish pranks like that can cost dearly if the
city guard is focused on your exhibitions rather than criminals' harmful acts. Do not think I
neither condone your activity nor ignored the fact that you pummeled a man severely. If you return
before me or my peers, we will not be so understanding. After your record is complete and if you or
your parents can pay the fine, I feel there is no need for a more detailed investigation.‚Äù

\*After paying the fine and heading out of the court building, the party ran into a waiting [[Bronson]].
He is currently training some of Lord Cummings bodyguards and was able to convince him to write the
letter in reference to Kereshi‚Äôs character. [[Bronson]] joins the party and Istari at the Lavish Pumpkin
for dinner. While [[Enyo]] and Tsakor walk to explore the town, Istari gets a message that he can bring
the party by the Winters estate in the morning if he would like to do so.

\*The next morning, the Istari and the party visit Lt Michael Winters at his estate. It is a large
estate. He is provided city guards on his property and maintains private security inside his house.

\*At the mention of the Putrid Lake, any apprehension seems to have evaporated, being involuntarily
replaced by excitement. ‚ÄúPutrid Lake you say. I have something on that in my collection. It is on
display right over here.‚Äù It was one of his earliest additions to his collection. Near the center,
sits a map a foot wide and 15 inches long. The parchment is aged, with a burnt corner and a
coin-sized burn hole near its center. Placed next to it so close they touch, a journal sits open to
the last entries a few pages from the end of the book. The journal is written in large print but by
a steady hand.

\*He says the journal is a very interesting read, telling of how life was in a time long ago. It is
a tale of a man who had two family members taken by a demon. He‚Äôs not sure if it was an actual demon
or that is just what the author calls it, but his guess is that it was indeed a fiend of some kind.
He believes this because a group of 28 people, including the author, travel from [[Blissville]] to
something he calls the Demon‚Äôs Door. You cannot tell where the Demon Door is, and no one I have
found has any idea where it is. But he knows it was in the mountains somewhere west of where
[[Blissville]] was razed.

\*Lt. Winters says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident the Door is a magical portal of some kind. The author says you
must picture the room beyond the door if you have been there, and imagine you are looking at
hellscape above you if you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

\*He gives Istari permission to make a copy of the map so long as they agree to give him the copy
when the party‚Äôs trip ends. Although the copy wouldn‚Äôt be valuable like the original, its existence
could reduce the value of the original.

\*Lt. Winters returns 208 gp to Gwyn that was recovered from a ‚Äòcult‚Äô that worships [[Kiputytto]], a
goddess known for sickness and disease.

\*Kereshi helps Istari by endless comments and improvements that she believes he should make. The
work is originally done. While neither is truly satisfied with it, it would probably be a matter of
debate whether it would have been better if Istari had done the work focused and alone.

\*Istari thanks the team one more time and departs for home as they head back to the Lavish Pumpkin
to determine their next steps.

The in-game time of day at the end of the session was: 1 pm on Month 7/Day 18
