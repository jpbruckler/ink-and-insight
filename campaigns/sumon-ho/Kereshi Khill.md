## Description

Short tempered and always looking for a fight, Kereshi stands head and shoulders above most people at nearly 7' tall. 

She favors the Greataxe and javelin, but recently came into possession of the [[Halberd of the Icelands]].
## Backstory

Kereshi was born in the savage wilds; now known as the [[Conquered Lands]]. She spent several years growing up with her father's tribe, the [[Skorch Skull Clan]] before joining a dwarven family. When she was old enough, she set out on her own.

As part of their plan to bring all of the Orc clans together, the [[Tear Bringers|Tear-Bringers]] tribe absorbed the [[Skorch Skull Clan]], an abominable act in Kereshi's eyes. 

Kereshi has been traveling with a human sorcerer named Justin for several months. They compliment each other well. Justin likes to consider his options and then act. Kereshi tends to be brash and impulsive. Justin prefers to solve problems in a political or least dangerous way if he can. Kereshi tends to find that the best way to solve problems is to break things.

## Goals & Motivations

- Gather enough support to challenge the leader of the [[Tear Bringers]], with the intent to "free" the [[Skorch Skull Clan|Skorch Skulls]].

## Allies & Contacts

- Justin - Volgo?

## Important Items

- [[Bag of Holding]]
- [[Halberd of the Icelands]]
- [[Javelin of Lightning]]
- [[Figurine of Wondrous Power]] (subterranean lizard)

## Notes & Development

- Kereshi was able to gather some orcs under her banner, they are currently in the [[Chillin Tower]]. The party has asked them to perform some light upkeep and to act as guards.
- During [[Gwyn Hovey|Gwyn's]] time with the party he tried to help Kereshi direct her anger into something more controlled, rather than lashing out at the slightest perceived affront. He had little success.
