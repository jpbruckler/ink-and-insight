Born August 14, 2015 in Detroit, MI. My father was a fisherman on Lake Erie. Mom was a mechanic. Once I was born, they struggled to pay rent on time, eventually being forced out of their home. With nowhere else to go we all lived on dad's boat, [[The Remora]]. Mom was the ship's mechanic when needed and a deckhand when not. Pops was the cook. 

When I was just 6 months old, the 3rd Corporate War broke out. It was mostly fought on the net, and was all the way out in L.A., far from us. Though the Bank of New York City wasn't that far away, and with the Rothstein Fund (a subsidiary of the Bank of New York) being attacked by MA&F, there was an opportunity for the bank to provide some "behind the scenes" help. 

Pops hadn't had a decent catch in over a month. With a hungry baby to feed and a boat to keep afloat, he was getting desperate. One day while unloading a small catch, he ran into a friend of his from high school by the name of [[Darryl Montague]]. Darryl was always a troublemaker, hatching one scheme or another, and he could spot a desperate man from a mile away. 

Darryl convinced my dad to pick up "a couple of guys" from the NYC Harbormaster and get them back to the Port of Detroit, a simple task for 5,000 eddies.

I never got the whole story of what happened, I know that whatever happened, the simple pick up and transport job went sideways. Pops lost an eye, nearly lost his boat, [[The Remora]]. One of the guys he transported was some hot-shot NYC solo, the other was a Nomad from Louisiana, [[Dixon "Gumbo" Matthews]]. Whatever happened, Uncle Gumbo (as I knew him) said he owed Pops his life. 

Uncle Gumbo was a character, and before long Mom and Pops found themselves just kind of "part of" a Nomad clan that formed around them. In 2020 our little clan joined up with the [[Thelas Nation]], a marine-based Nomad nation formed in 2017 in the Caribbean and moved their way up North through the Mississippi River delta and the eastern seaboard.

When I was 17 (2032) I met [[Sweet Anita]] when I was delivering some "liberated" Quadra turbochargers to the garage my Mom worked at. Before too long Anita and I were thick as thieves, and I was spending more time on 4 wheels than I was on the water. One day Anita decided she wanted to skip town, and with my parent's blessing, I went with her. We didn't really have a plan or a destination, but we ended up in Night City in the summer of 2033, during the first phase of the rebuilding.

I picked up some odd jobs with the Aldecados to earn some money, and Anita found several like-minded individuals among the engineers and gearheads of the [[Aldacados]]. 

In 2035 Anita was shot during a job because the fixer we got the job from had bad intel. We were supposed to deliver some supplies to [[Stormtech Corporation]], so we bandaged Anita up best we could and finished the delivery, hoping to get Anita patched up by one of their docs. By the time we got her there, the shrapnel in her belly had shifted, nicking her lower intestine. Within a couple of hours she was septic, and I lost my one tie to home.
