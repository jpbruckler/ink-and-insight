> [!summary] Recap
>[[Borderline]] and [[Tempest]] did a gig for [[Hornet]] and [[Fox]], rescuing some high-energy explosives and earning enough for rent - assuming we don't spend it all.

- Sarah's character is [[Bee]] (medtech), she was working a side hustle when we worked the gig
- [[Kenny]] is our fixer

We hammer out some deets:

- The 3 of us live together in some connected cargo containers in Old Japantown


Around 10:30, we get a call from Kenny, our fixer. Kenny says [[Hornet]] was pleased with the way the gig went down, and sent us the 2k eddies.

After that, [[Tempest]] gets a call from [[Kento Matsumato]], a friend of his in the [[University District]]. I've got nothing better to do, so I agree to give him a ride, and Bee decides to come with us.

Kento received an encoded message and they wanted some help deciphering it.

When we get to the University District, Kento gives Tempest the message. Tempest is able to decipher it, and reads it aloud. Not that Borderline was listening too much. He did hear that it was in Watson, and we needed to be there at 3.

We grab some food and park across the street, watching the convenience store. We see some buff dudes with haircuts like Tempest's. 

Tempest lets us know that the tall one is called [[Flash Gordon]] and the big guy is [[Thing 2]], the heavy weapons specialist from Tempest's crew.

Bee and I will let Tempest head up and engage, we give him a minute, then slink out of the car. 

The message was from Tempest's old team, reaching out to make contact. They suspect someone betrayed the team.

Bee and I are in the alley, peeking into the window, watching.

As we watch, it's clear that this is a friendly meetup, so Bee and I make our way into the convenience store.

I buy 150eb of nachos.

Flash gives us a gig, we gotta grab some stiff out from under the NCPDs nose. We're going to need:

- a cryo-pump
- a transport

Going to call [[Weasel]] to try to get an Ambulance. Weasel actually calls me, [[Darryl Montague]] is in the Aldecado camp. He busted my balls a little, but he's going to try to scrounge one up.

Kenny has us an hour window between 11pm and midnight.

The morgue is in Watson. Tempest and Bee are going to stay in Watson while I go get the ambulance.

Driving back to the Family to meet [[Darryl Montague|Darryl]], I just get more and more annoyed. I grab the keys for the ambulance from Weasel. They've put Darryl in a tent with guards outside. 

He has a job to assassinate someone and needs a ride. He offers 80/20 split. I negotiate a 60/40 split AND he can't call me for 6 mos.

He's going to call me Friday/Saturday.

I drop him in [[The Glen]] then make a bee-line back to Watson.

---

I pull up to Flash's convenience store at 8pm.

We wait around and leave around midnight. As we get going on the road, we pick up a tail.


Ambulance is a compact ground car
Health: 50
 -23
Move: 20

We get rammed by a 4 door sedan, painted with a skull - Maelstrom.
We exchange some fire, then I slam on the brakes. We exchange a couple more rounds on the side of the road, but nobody hits anything.

I get annoyed, fuckin Darryl's got me all  bent out of shape, so I floor it, ramming into the driver's side door that the driver was using as a shield, killing him and busting up the door.
